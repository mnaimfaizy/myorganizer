# Vault architecture pages

Two self-contained pages describing how the vault actually works. Open either in a browser — no
build step, no network, no server.

| Page                                       | Answers                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [trust-boundary.html](trust-boundary.html) | **Where the line is.** Which zone holds keys, which hold only ciphertext, and what crosses     |
| [lifecycle.html](lifecycle.html)           | **What happens over time.** Seven scenes from creating a vault to restoring it on a new device |

Start with the lifecycle if you are new to the vault; it ends by pointing at the boundary map,
which is the reference you come back to.

## Why they exist

The security properties are documented correctly in prose, but they are spread across
`libs/vault-core`, `libs/web-vault`, `libs/mobile/feat/vault`, a Prisma schema, and a feature
doc. Nobody holds them all at once. The failure these pages prevent is concrete: someone adds a
convenient endpoint, or logs an object while debugging, and moves plaintext or a key across a
line they could not see.

The boundary map carries a reading test for exactly that — if a change adds an arrow leaving the
device, it may carry ciphertext, KDF parameters, or backup metadata, and nothing else.

## Keeping them honest

Both pages embed a JSON manifest of the constants they assert. `yarn vault:pages:check` diffs
those manifests against the constants in source and fails when they diverge:

```bash
yarn vault:pages:check
```

Treat a failure as "the diagram is stale", not "the check is broken". It covers 31 assertions —
KDF parameters, cipher byte lengths, the envelope schema version, all seven size caps across the
three layers that enforce them, the six blob types, the nine import error codes, and both Local
Vault storage keys.

Blob types and error codes are compared as sets rather than sequences, so a page may order them
by the sequence a reader meets them.

The two Local Vault keys are asserted as a pair, and `localVaultKeys.ownerScoped` is compared
against the composition read out of `localVaultStorageKey()` rather than against a pinned string.
A page may not name one key without the other. Both rules exist because the retired `storageKey`
field stayed byte-identical while its meaning changed, and the check went on passing against a page
that sent readers to the wrong slot — see [ADR 0051](../adr/0051-a-pinned-value-does-not-notice-that-its-meaning-moved.md).

Values the pages show that are **not** yet assertable are listed in each manifest under
`notYetExported` — currently the KDF and cipher figures, which are module-private constants. To
bring them under the check, export them and add them to `SOURCES` in
`tools/scripts/check-vault-pages.mjs`.

## Changing them

**These two files are the source.** There is nothing to regenerate them from.

Both pages began as dc-runtime design exports, which `tools/scripts/build-agent-map.mjs` imported
once in August 2026 — inlining the design-system stylesheet, embedding both typefaces as woff2
data URIs, and deciding how much runtime to carry from the page itself (`lifecycle.html` binds
templates so it carries React; `trust-boundary.html` does not and ships as plain DOM at roughly a
third the size). The `.dc.html` exports were never committed, and every correction since has been
made to the built pages against the source constants. Re-importing an old export would silently
revert them.

So a change here is an edit to the page, briefed through
[`design-brief`](../../.agents/skills/design-brief/SKILL.md) and executed by the `Designer`
sub-agent, exactly as [ADR 0046](../adr/0046-house-explainer-pages-have-a-designer-and-a-gate.md)
describes for every House Explainer Page. `build-agent-map.mjs` remains the importer for a _new_
canvas export; it is not a rebuild path for these two.

Both are in `.prettierignore`, so an edit is not reformatted out from under you by the pre-commit
hook.
