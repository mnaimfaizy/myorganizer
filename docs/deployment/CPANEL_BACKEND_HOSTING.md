# Backend API on cPanel

How the MyOrganizer backend (Node/Express + Prisma) runs on Namecheap cPanel
shared hosting, for both Staging and Production. Staging and Production are
separate app roots with separate databases on the same kind of host; the
[environment table](#what-differs-between-environments) is the only place they
differ.

This document describes the host. It does not describe how a deploy is started
or approved — that is [CI/CD and release process](CI_CD_AND_RELEASE_PROCESS.md) —
and it does not carry the Host Apply sequence, which lives once, in
[Host Apply: operator setup](HOST_APPLY_OPERATOR_SETUP.md).

> The repository is public. Host, port, user, home paths, and app-root values
> are GitHub Environment secrets, never text in this file
> ([ADR 0056](../adr/0056-ci-owns-host-apply-without-describing-the-jail.md)).
> `<APP_ROOT>` below means that environment's `APP_ROOT` secret.

## What differs between environments

| Concern               | Staging                                                                                 | Production                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| API origin            | `API_ORIGIN` secret on the `staging` Environment                                        | `https://api.myorganiser.app`                                                                   |
| Frontend it serves    | The Vercel Staging frontend ([Vercel hosting](VERCEL_FRONTEND_HOSTING.md))              | `https://myorganiser.app` on cPanel ([Web app on cPanel](CPANEL_WEB_HOSTING.md))                |
| `CORS_ORIGINS`        | The Staging frontend origin: the domain of the Vercel project `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` names | `https://myorganiser.app,https://www.myorganiser.app`                                           |
| `APP_FRONTEND_URL`    | That same Staging frontend origin                                                       | `https://myorganiser.app`                                                                       |
| `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` | That Staging frontend origin + `/dashboard/youtube/callback`                            | `https://myorganiser.app/dashboard/youtube/callback`                                            |
| YouTube cron jobs     | **Not installed** — Staging is QA only                                                  | Installed ([YouTube integration](../features/youtube-integration.md#cpanel-cron-configuration)) |
| Bundle upload         | Automatic after CI is green on `main`                                                   | After Deploy Approval on a `release/vX.Y.Z` run                                                 |
| Host Apply            | Operator-dispatched `Deploy Staging` run; required green before a Cut                   | Runs after Deploy Approval; required green before a Tag                                         |

Everything not in this table is the same in both environments.

## The bundle

```bash
yarn nx run backend:package
```

Produces `dist/deploy/backend-api/` (and `backend-api.zip`):

- `main.js` — the startup file.
- A deploy-only `package.json` and `package-lock.json`, plus npm guardrail
  config, generated from the reviewed Yarn build output.
- `prisma.config.cjs` and the `prisma/` folder (schema and migrations).
- `CPANEL_STARTUP.md` with the exact startup file name.

It deliberately contains no `node_modules`. The Prisma client is generated on
the host, so it is built for the host's OS.

CI builds and uploads this bundle for you; build it locally only to inspect it.

## One-time setup per environment

### 1. Database

1. cPanel → **PostgreSQL Databases**.
2. Create a database and a user; grant the user ALL privileges on it.
3. The app reads it as
   `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<user>:<pass>@localhost:5432/<db>`.

`DATABASE_URL` lives only in the Node.js app's environment variables on the
host. It is never a GitHub secret; Host Apply reads it from the host.

### 2. Node.js application

cPanel → **Setup Node.js App** → **Create Application**:

```
Node.js Version: 22.x
Application Mode: Production
Application Root: <APP_ROOT>
Application URL: <that environment's API origin>
Application Startup File: main.js
```

Do not use the cPanel **Run NPM Install** button for the backend. It runs a
plain `npm install`, which can re-resolve dependencies; Host Apply runs
`npm ci --omit=dev` against the bundled lockfile instead.

### 3. Environment variables

Set these in the Node.js app's **Environment Variables**. Values that differ
between environments are in the [table above](#what-differs-between-environments).

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000

# API routing
ROUTER_PREFIX=/api/v1

# CORS and email links — see the environment table
CORS_ORIGINS=<frontend origins, comma-separated>
APP_FRONTEND_URL=<frontend origin>

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<user>:<pass>@localhost:5432/<db>

# JWT
ACCESS_JWT_SECRET=<strong-random>
REFRESH_JWT_SECRET=<strong-random>
VERIFY_JWT_SECRET=<strong-random>
RESET_JWT_SECRET=<strong-random>

# Mail — auth verify/reset and the YouTube weekly digest share this transport.
# EmailService reads DEFAULT_EMAIL_PROVIDER. The MAIL_SERVICE key in
# .env.example is not read by the app; setting it alone does nothing.
DEFAULT_EMAIL_PROVIDER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=<cpanel-server-hostname>   # businessNN.web-hosting.com, not mail.<domain>
MAIL_PORT=465
MAIL_SECURE=true
MAIL_USERNAME=noreply@<domain>
MAIL_PASSWORD=<mailbox-password>
EMAIL_SENDER=noreply@<domain>

# YouTube integration
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<oauth-client-id>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<oauth-client-secret>
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=<frontend origin>/dashboard/youtube/callback
YOUTUBE_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<64-char-hex>
YOUTUBE_CRON_SECRET=<shared-secret>
```

`.env.example` in the repository has the full list.

- `MAIL_USERNAME` and `MAIL_PASSWORD` are read as a pair: set only one and the
  transport authenticates as nobody.
- Mail must work before any feature that sends: email verification, password
  reset, and the YouTube weekly digest all share one transport.
- `YOUTUBE_CRON_SECRET` must **also** exist in the cron wrapper's own env file on
  Production, because cPanel cron does not inherit Passenger environment
  variables. `YOUTUBE_API_BASE_URL` belongs only in that file, never here. The
  mailbox, SPF/DKIM, and crontab steps live in
  [YouTube integration](../features/youtube-integration.md#cpanel-cron-configuration).
- Restart the app after changing any variable; Passenger reads them at boot.

### 4. Host Apply access

Before CI can take a bundle live, the environment needs a deploy key on the host
and its secrets filled in. Follow
[Host Apply: operator setup](HOST_APPLY_OPERATOR_SETUP.md) end to end, and run
`yarn host-apply:preflight <environment>` until it is green.

## How a bundle goes live

Uploading files changes nothing the running process uses. A bundle is live only
after **Host Apply** — install, migrate, regenerate the Prisma client, restart,
verify — has gone green for it. Release v0.4.0 served Production with four unapplied migrations, and
the deploy that fixed them still answered every cron call with a 500 because the
Prisma client predated the new models (#273, #437).

- **CI runs it.** Staging: dispatch `Deploy Staging` (use `apply_only` when the
  bundle is already uploaded) with SSH shell access switched on. Production: it
  follows Deploy Approval. See
  [CI/CD and release process](CI_CD_AND_RELEASE_PROCESS.md#host-apply-staging--production).
- **When Actions cannot connect**, the fallback is interactive SSH with the same
  sequence: [Break-glass](HOST_APPLY_OPERATOR_SETUP.md#break-glass). Do not keep a
  copy of the commands anywhere else; the operator guide records the host
  behaviours they depend on.

A green Host Apply already checks that no migration is pending, that `/docs`
answers, and that a wrong-secret cron call is rejected with `401` by the app
rather than by the web server.

One check it cannot make: that mail is actually delivered. `EmailService` hands
nodemailer a callback and logs failures rather than throwing, so a 2xx from the
API never proves delivery. After changing mail settings, trigger a password reset
for your own account and confirm the message arrives from `EMAIL_SENDER`.

## Troubleshooting

### CORS errors in the browser console

- `CORS_ORIGINS` must include the exact frontend origin for that environment
  (and `https://www.myorganiser.app` on Production if it is used).
- Restart the Node app after changing it.

### API works via curl but the frontend fails

- The frontend's `API_BASE_URL` is missing or wrong — see
  [Web app on cPanel](CPANEL_WEB_HOSTING.md) or
  [Vercel hosting](VERCEL_FRONTEND_HOSTING.md).
- Router prefix mismatch: the API serves under `/api/v1`.

### Cron endpoint answers 404, HTML 403, or 500

- `404` — the running build predates the split cron endpoints; Host Apply has
  not run for the current bundle.
- HTML `403` — LiteSpeed refused the request before it reached Node. A POST with
  no `Content-Type` and no body is rejected on every path; send
  `Content-Type: application/json` and `{}`.
- `500` — usually a stale Prisma client. Dispatch Host Apply; do not patch the
  host by hand.

### Prisma errors

- Re-check `DATABASE_URL` in the app's environment variables.
- `Could not load --schema ... prisma/schema: file or directory not found` means
  the command ran outside `<APP_ROOT>`: the directory must contain
  `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, **and** `prisma/`.
- Pending migrations or a stale client: dispatch Host Apply.

### Node app won't start

- Read `stderr.log` / `stdout.log` in `<APP_ROOT>`.
- Missing environment variables, especially `DATABASE_URL` and the JWT secrets.
- Missing dependencies: dispatch Host Apply, which re-runs `npm ci --omit=dev`.

## Monitoring and maintenance

- cPanel **Metrics** → Errors / Resource Usage.
- External uptime monitoring on `https://api.myorganiser.app/docs` (Production).
- Regular PostgreSQL backups.
- Keep the last known good `backend-api.zip`. There is no automated rollback:
  a failed Host Apply leaves the host as it was, and recovery is a fix and a
  re-run, not a migrate-down.
