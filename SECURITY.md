## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not open a public issue or pull request for suspected vulnerabilities.

Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting when it is enabled. If private reporting is not available, contact the repository owner, `@mnaimfaizy`, through GitHub and keep the details private until triage is complete.

Include the following in the report:

- Affected branch, commit SHA, package name, and version
- A short impact summary and expected blast radius
- Reproduction steps or a minimal proof of concept
- Any indicators of compromise, logs, or relevant dependency diffs
- Whether secrets, CI runners, or developer workstations may have been exposed

## Response Expectations

- Initial acknowledgement target: 3 business days
- Triage target: 7 business days
- Status updates: provided after triage and during coordinated remediation

## Disclosure Guidelines

- Keep reports private until a fix or mitigation is available.
- Rotate exposed secrets immediately if a dependency or CI compromise is suspected.
- Rebuild affected environments from a known-good lockfile after containment.

## Additional Guidance

Repository-specific dependency and CI hardening guidance lives in `docs/SECURITY/Dependency-Supply-Chain-Security-Plan.md`.
