 * typed before hydration lands in the DOM but never reaches React state, and
 * submitting posts an empty form. The suite used to cover that with
 * `waitForLoadState('networkidle')` plus a 1.5s WebKit sleep. Neither observes
 * hydration: `networkidle` is DISCOURAGED by Playwright and hangs against a
 * production build, and a sleep is a guess (ADR 0050, issue #524).
 *
 * Password visibility is pure client state, so the field only unmasks once
 * `onClick` is bound — which makes it the one tell that hydration has landed.
 * The click is retried because a pre-hydration click is dropped, then reversed
 * so the caller starts from the masked field a user sees, and so
 * `input[type="password"]` still selects it.
 *
 * The alternation matters: the button relabels itself between "Show password"
 * and "Hide password", so a fixed name matches only half the time. Anchoring
 * then keeps it off signup's confirm-password eye, labelled "Show confirm
 * password".
 *
 * `password` is passed in because the two forms identify the field differently
 * — login has an `id`, signup does not.
