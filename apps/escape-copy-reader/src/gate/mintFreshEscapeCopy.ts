 * second decision is that a gate asserts the reader still opens a *freshly
 * produced* envelope — "a reader pinned to a schema version the exporter has
 * moved past is worse than no reader: it fails at the only moment anyone runs
 * it, and it fails silently until then". A fixture envelope checked into the
 * repository would not assert that, because a fixture moves when somebody
 * remembers to move it. So this calls `exportVault` — the function the Export
 * button and the Drive backup both call — and hands the gate whatever it
 * produces today.
 *
 * It is not application code and ships in nothing: `tools/scripts/check-escape-copy-reader.mjs`
 * bundles this file for Node, runs it, and throws the result away.

 * The KDF iteration count this harness wraps its throwaway Master Key at.

 * Pinned here rather than read from the app, and deliberately not a claim
 * about the app's number. The gate asserts a round-trip — what the exporter
 * put in is what the reader gets back — and the reader takes the iteration
 * count off the envelope it is handed rather than from a constant of its own
 * ([ADR 0051](../../../../docs/adr/0051-a-pinned-value-does-not-notice-that-its-meaning-moved.md)),

 * Kept low-drama on purpose: raising it slows every gate run by the same
