/**
 * The Escape Copy reader's page — the only part of the reader that is not
 * shared with the app.
 *
 * Everything that decides anything lives in `@myorganizer/vault-core`:
 * `openEscapeCopy` parses the envelope, unwraps the Master Key and decrypts
 * every Vault Blob Type, using the same schema and the same crypto the
 * exporter ran. This file reads a file the User picked, reads a secret the
 * User typed, and renders what comes back. Keeping the split exactly there is
 * what ADR 0064's gate can assert: a reader with its own copy of the crypto
 * would be a second implementation of the thing that must never disagree with
 * the first.
 *
 * Three properties are load-bearing and are asserted by
 * `tools/scripts/check-escape-copy-reader.mjs`:
 *
 *   1. **Nothing is sent.** No `fetch`, no `XMLHttpRequest`, no `WebSocket`,
 *      no dynamic `import()`, and no external `src`/`href` in the page. The
 *      file opens from `file://` with the network cable out, which is the
 *      only situation it was built for.
 *   2. **Nothing is stored.** No `localStorage`, no `sessionStorage`, no
 *      cookies. A passphrase typed into this page exists for as long as the
 *      tab does.
 *   3. **Nothing is written to disk.** v1 browses on screen. Offering a
 *      "download decrypted archive" button would turn one deliberate act of
 *      recovery into a plaintext file the User then has to remember to
 *      delete.
 *
 * `bootstrap` is exported and called only when a `document` is present, so the
 * gate can load this bundle outside a browser and call `openEscapeCopy`
 * against the real artifact.
