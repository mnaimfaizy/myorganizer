/**
 * What the Vault Gate shows once Vault Absent Evidence has settled.
 *
 * Mirrors `vaultClaimEvidenceGateView.ts` for the `absent` branch
 * ([ADR 0066](../../../../docs/adr/0066-a-convergence-pass-runs-freely-and-only-the-question-is-suppressed.md),
 * decision point 4): one outcome carries on to the ordinary create offer,
 * because creating is safe exactly when the server holds nothing either. The
 * other three withhold it. `server-holds-vault` is the one with no ordinary
 * status to fall back to and no `cannot-check` copy either — the server did
 * answer, and what it said was "not this control": Vault Reconcile is
 * already bringing the real Vault onto this device, and minting a fresh
 * Master Key over it is the single most destructive control in the product,
 * offered at the moment a User is most likely to reach for it.
 *
 * Pinned rather than switched on, so a new Vault Absent Evidence outcome
 * fails to compile until somebody says what the User sees for it
 * ([ADR 0053](../../../../docs/adr/0053-a-fan-out-over-a-domain-enum-is-pinned-at-its-call-site.md)).
