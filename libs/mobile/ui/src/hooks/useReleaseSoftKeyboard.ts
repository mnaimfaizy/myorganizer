 * Closes the soft keyboard once a text input has lost focus to something

 *
 * Android leaves the keyboard up when a hardware keyboard's Tab moves focus
 * from a text input to a button, and it stays up over whatever sits at the
 * bottom of the screen — and over the next screen, if the button opened one.
 * `Keyboard.dismiss()` cannot close it: it blurs the input React Native
 * counts as focused, and by then there is none.
 *
 * The check waits until the events behind the blur have all been handled,
 * because an input loses focus before the next one is told it has it. Moving
 * between two text inputs, by Tab or by the keyboard's own "next", therefore
 * leaves the keyboard alone.
 *
 * An input removed by its own blur — the Tasks composer collapses on it — is
 * gone before that check, so it closes the keyboard as it leaves instead.
 *
 * Touch does not come through here with the keyboard up: a tap on a button
 * leaves focus in the input, and `Keyboard.dismiss()` has hidden the keyboard
 * before the blur it causes arrives.
