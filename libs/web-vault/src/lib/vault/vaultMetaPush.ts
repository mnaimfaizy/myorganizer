/**
 * Vault Meta Push — the direction Vault Meta Converge deliberately cannot go.
 *
 * Converge asks whether this device should start using a wrapping made
 * somewhere else, and it can never check its own answer: a wrapping cannot be
 * verified without the passphrase it was derived from, which is why adoption
 * never happens without an explicit answer and why that module structurally
 * cannot write ([ADR 0057](../../../../../docs/adr/0057-vault-meta-converges-separately-and-never-silently.md)).
 *
 * A push is the opposite act. The wrapping being sent is one this device
 * wrote itself, so there is nothing to verify — but it can still land on top
 * of a wrapping some other device wrote, and that is the whole hazard here.
 * The safety claim is deliberately *not* "this device holds the Master Key
 * unlocked". That is true of the push made right after a change and false of
 * the retry, which runs at session start against a Vault that is usually
 * locked. What holds for both is narrower:
 *
 *   a device may push a wrapping it wrote itself, and only over a server
 *   state it can prove has not moved since.
 *
 * The Vault Meta Bookmark carries that proof. Everything else in this module
 * is arranged so that no path reaches `putVaultMeta` without it.
 *
 * This module writes; `vaultMetaConverge.ts` still does not. `settleVaultMeta`
 * composes the two exactly as `vaultReconcile.ts` composes `convergeVaultBlob`
 * — the write capability lives here, above the primitive, never inside it.

 * Whether a local wrapping may be pushed over a server Vault Meta that

 *
 * Checked before the base comparison, deliberately: a server holding a
 * separately initialized Vault is not a stale base to be caught up, it is a
 * different Vault, and no proof about the base makes pushing over it right.
 * Pushing there would leave the server's Ciphertext guarded by a key it was
 * not encrypted under — exactly
 * [#578](https://github.com/mnaimfaizy/myorganizer/issues/578) pointing the
 * other way.
 *
 * It guards a second case that does not exist yet. `changePassphrase`
 * re-derives from the salt the Vault already has, which is what keeps a
 * rotation legible as a rotation; a future change that minted a fresh salt
 * would make this device's own rotation read as a different Vault, and this
 * table is what stops that becoming a silent data hazard rather than a
 * refusal.
 *
