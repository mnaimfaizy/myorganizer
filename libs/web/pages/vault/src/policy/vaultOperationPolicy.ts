/**
 * Which Vault states permit which Vault page operations (ADR 0068).
 *
 * The locked answer is **derived, not chosen per card**: a locked Vault blocks
 * exactly the operations that need the Master Key. Passphrase change and
 * Recovery Key rotation must unwrap or rewrap it and genuinely cannot run while
 * locked. Import, export, removal, and cloud backup touch only Ciphertext, and
 * unlock is a plaintext-access boundary rather than a network one (CONTEXT.md),
 * so a locked Vault never blocked them.
 *
 * `signed-out` and `no-local-vault` block everything, uniformly. That is
 * correctness rather than security: in those states there is no Local Vault for
 * any of the six operations to act on.
 *
 * This table implements ADR 0068 §3 as written; whether uniform `no-local-vault`
 * blocking is right for import is deferred to PRD #658.
 *
 * Every answer lives in `VAULT_OPERATION_POLICY`, one `satisfies
 * Record<VaultOperation, …>` table (ADR 0053), so a seventh card cannot be added
 * without stating what it does while locked.
