# App API Client

Generated code for web client based on OpenAPI spec of [App API](../app-api-spec/src/api-specs.openapi.yaml).

## Setup

The `generate-sources` builder has been pre-configured and can be modified as needed in `workspace.json`.

In order to generate the sources, run:

```sh
yarn api:generate
```

The above should be run every time the [API spec file](../api-specs/src/api-specs.openapi.yaml) changes.
