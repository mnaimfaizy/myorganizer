/**
 * The structured Upstream Brief report contract (ADR 0084 item 3 and item 10).
 *
 * A research worker writes a report matching `INPUT SHAPE` below. This module
 * turns it into a **normalized report**: the same envelope, with every entry
 * the contract could not accept moved into an `unverified` list carrying a
 * named reason, plus the counts a reader needs. That asymmetry is the whole
 * decision — a code review computes a verdict that one bad finding corrupts,
 * so it rejects the report whole; a brief has no verdict, and losing an
 * Ecosystem's good findings to one bad citation costs more than listing the
 * bad one (ADR 0084, Considered Options).
 *
 * `unverified` and `counts` are computed, never written. A report arriving
 * with either is rejected, for the same reason the code-review contract
 * rejects a hand-written verdict: a derived field the author can forge is not
 * derived.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE IS HERE, AND NOT IN tools/scripts/
 *   The skill is portable (ADR 0018, retained by ADR 0084). A validator living
 *   in this repo's script tree would make a brief checkable only in this repo.
 *   So this module imports **nothing at all** — not a dependency, not even a
 *   Node built-in — and `validate-report.mjs` beside it is the only part that
 *   touches a filesystem or a git binary. `.agents/skills/upstream-brief/report.test.mjs`
 *   asserts that import-freedom, because "dependency-free" is the kind of
 *   claim that rots the first time somebody reaches for a helper.
 *
 * WHY LOCAL EVIDENCE IS CHECKED AT ALL
 *   The three briefs written under ADR 0018 cited `file:line` with no commit,
 *   inside a document frozen at its date, and carried two Correction blocks
 *   for three wrong claims. A quotation nothing compares to anything is a
 *   claim, not evidence (ADR 0078). Every local citation here carries the
 *   file, the line, and the literal text at that line, and every one of them
 *   is read back out of the tree at the commit the report records — which is
 *   also what lets a frozen brief stay valid after the tree moves on.
 *
 *   The four failure reasons mirror the review pipeline's
 *   (`tools/scripts/review/obligations.mjs`) deliberately and **by copying the
 *   rule rather than the code**: a reader who knows one vocabulary knows both,
 *   and the skill stays portable. The duplication is the price of that, and it
 *   is written down here so the next person does not "fix" it with an import.
 *
 * INPUT SHAPE
 *   report              schemaVersion, date, commit, ecosystems[], scanned[],
 *                       failedHops[], delta?
 *   ecosystem           lead, members[], baseline, horizon?, driftNotes[],
 *                       findings[], checkedAndClear[], opportunities[],
 *                       incidental[]
 *   upstreamFinding     type, urgency, claim, evidence, source{url, quote,
 *                       pageVersion}, local[{file,line,text}], executed?{command,
 *                       exitCode}, disposition
 *   checkedAndClear     claim, source{url, quote, pageVersion},
 *                       local[{file,line,text}], holdsFor
 *   upstreamOpportunity technique, source{url, pageVersion}, benefitQuote,
 *                       minVersion?, local[{file,line,text}]
 *   incidentalObservation summary, local[{file,line,text}], owner
 *
 *   An Opportunity spells its verbatim quote `benefitQuote` rather than
 *   `source.quote` because ADR 0084 item 8 makes that quote the benefit
 *   itself — "its benefit is the upstream's quoted statement, never an
 *   estimate". It is checked exactly like any other source quote.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO
 *   The ledger carry-forward (ADR 0084 item 11 — a checked-and-clear claim
 *   whose recorded range still covers a new Baseline is carried forward
 *   without new research) lives in `ledger.mjs`: it reads the *previous*
 *   committed report against a *new* Baseline, and this module validates
 *   exactly one report in isolation. The `delta` this contract validates is
 *   the ledger's output, not its own work.
 *
 *   Everything else ADR 0084 states about one report's own entries is
 *   enforced here, in `validateEntry` and the per-Ecosystem pass in
 *   `normalizeUpstreamReport`: `absent` Evidence alone cannot support a
 *   `mismatch` (item 3), a `broken-now` claim without `executed` Evidence is
 *   downgraded rather than trusted at face value (item 5), an Ecosystem
 *   carries at most three Opportunities (item 8), an Opportunity whose
 *   `minVersion` sits above the Baseline is valid only when a Horizon covers
 *   it (item 8), and an Incidental Observation — never an Upstream Finding,
 *   never counted as one — cannot carry a plan disposition (item 7).
