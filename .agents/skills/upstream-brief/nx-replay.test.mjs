/**
 * Replay fixture: the Nx brief's three corrected claims (ADR 0084, Context),
 * restated under the structured report contract and its domain rules.
 *
 * `docs/research/2026-08-21-upstream-brief-nx.md` carries two Correction
 * blocks for three wrong claims, written under ADR 0018's free-Markdown
 * rules with no validator to catch any of them before they were committed:
 *
 *   1. "Absence from the CLI reference" was read as "removed" — an earlier
 *      draft asserted `nx dep-graph` and `nx affected:graph` do not exist,
 *      citing their absence from the docs. Running them disproved that.
 *   2. "22 executor targets" was later found to be 54 — the first count
 *      covered `apps/` only, despite the sentence claiming `libs/**` too.
 *   3. The `eslint:lint` rename in `nx.json` was called "deliberate" — a
 *      claim about local git history with no upstream statement behind it,
 *      and `git log -S` showed it was not.
 *
 * This fixture restates each claim as an Upstream Brief report would author
 * it today and asserts how the validator classifies it:
 *
 *   1. Restated as the earlier draft actually wrote it — `type: mismatch`,
 *      `evidence: absent` — it is refused, not accepted as a mismatch
 *      (ADR 0084 item 3, this slice's own rule). The corrected shape (a
 *      missed-improvement or a claim citing something the docs affirmatively
 *      say) is a different finding this fixture does not need to restate to
 *      make the point.
 *   2. Restated with the corrected count and real local citations, it is a
 *      valid future-risk finding. The contract does not re-derive "54" —
 *      it checks that each cited line says what the claim says it says,
 *      which is the whole of what a citation check can prove.
 *   3. Restated as what it always was — a claim about local git history no
 *      upstream statement grounds — it is an Incidental Observation, not an
 *      Upstream Finding, and (this slice's own rule) cannot carry the `plan`
 *      disposition the original brief gave it.
