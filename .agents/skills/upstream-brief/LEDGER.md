# The ledger: what a run remembers

The latest committed structured report for an Ecosystem is its **ledger**. A new run reads it
before any research hop spends a token: a checked-and-clear Instruction Claim that still holds is
carried forward, everything else is researched again, and the brief opens with a delta
([ADR 0084](../../../docs/adr/0084-an-upstream-brief-is-anchored-to-what-is-installed-and-accepted-on-checked-evidence.md)
item 11). The same file also owns declined Upstream Opportunities (item 12), because both are the
same thing — one run's decision, read by the next.

| File                 | What it is                                                                             |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ledger.mjs`         | The decisions. Carry-forward, finding classification, declined Opportunities.          |
| `resolve-ledger.mjs` | The command: what this repo's Ecosystems would carry forward, and what they would not. |

```bash
node .agents/skills/upstream-brief/resolve-ledger.mjs
```

It asserts nothing and always exits 0. The gate is `tools/scripts/check-upstream-briefs.mjs`,
which fails on a declined entry whose Ecosystem or path is gone.

## Carry-forward

A claim is carried forward when **both** hold:

- its `holdsFor` range covers the new Baseline, and
- every line it quotes still says what it said, read at the current commit.

Anything else goes back on the research list with a named reason:

| Reason                   | Meaning                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `baseline-outside-range` | the Baseline moved out of the range the claim was recorded as holding for |
| `unreadable-range`       | `holdsFor` is not a range this module parses                              |
| `no-local-evidence`      | the claim quotes no instruction text, so nothing can be shown unchanged   |
| `instruction-changed`    | a quoted line moved, changed, or its file is gone                         |

`no-local-evidence` is the one that is easy to read as too strict. The range says which upstream
versions the statement covers; it never says this repo still states what it stated. A claim
carrying no local citation has nothing that could be shown unchanged, so carrying it forward on
the range alone would carry a claim about a repository that nobody looked at.

An Ecosystem the ledger has never seen carries nothing and re-checks nothing: everything about it
is researched, and the delta is absent — which is exactly what an absent `delta` key means in the
report contract.

## The delta

After research, this run's findings are classified against the ledger's into `newFindings`,
`resolved`, and `stillPresent` — the shape the report contract validates and
[the renderer](REPORT.md) prints as the brief's first section.

Two findings are the same finding when their **type**, their **upstream URL**, and their **claim**
(whitespace collapsed, case folded) match. There is no finding id in the contract, and one a
worker writes would make "is this the same finding?" a thing a worker decides. The key errs
toward over-reporting: a re-worded claim reads as one resolved plus one new, where a looser key
would quietly merge two different findings about one page and report neither.

## Version ranges

Three forms, and nothing else:

| Form                   | Example            | Covers                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| exact                  | `16.2.6`           | that version                    |
| wildcard tail          | `22.x`, `0.80.*`   | that line                       |
| comparator conjunction | `>=15.0.0 <17.0.0` | everything satisfying all terms |

Caret and tilde are refused by name rather than approximated: `^0.2.3` means `>=0.2.3 <0.3.0`
while `^1.2.3` means `>=1.2.3 <2.0.0`, and the React Native Ecosystem sits on the 0.x line where
that difference decides the answer. A range read too wide carries a claim forward that should have
been researched again, which is the outcome the ledger exists to prevent.

## Declined Upstream Opportunities

The adapter records them under `declined_opportunities` ([ADAPTER.md](ADAPTER.md)). An entry is
identity (Ecosystem, upstream URL, local site path), a one-line reason, the Baseline range it was
declined at, and the upstream quote at the time.

- **Suppressed** while the Baseline is inside that range **and** the upstream quote is unchanged.
- **Resurfaces** when either moves — `baseline-left-range` or `quote-changed`. "No, not at 22" is
  not "no, forever".
- **Fails the gate** when its Ecosystem is no longer declared or its site path is not in the tree:
  the entry then silences nothing and records a decision about something that is not there.

An entry whose range nothing can read suppresses nothing. That is the opposite of the
carry-forward rule above, where an unreadable range means "research it again", and it is the same
rule underneath: when the ledger cannot say, the run does the work and the human sees the result.
