// For every Ecosystem the adapter declares, it resolves the new Baseline the
// same way `resolve-baseline.mjs` does, finds that Ecosystem's ledger — the
// latest committed structured report in the brief directory that carries it —
// and reports which checked-and-clear claims survive into this run, which go
// back on the research list and why, and which declined Upstream
// Opportunities are still suppressed at the new Baseline.
//
// WHICH TREE THE INSTRUCTION TEXT IS READ FROM
//   The working tree, which is the tree a run about to be made is about. A
//   frozen report is a different question — its citations are compared to the
//   commit it records, and `yarn upstream:briefs:check` is what does that.
//
// NOT A GATE. It asserts nothing and always exits 0, exactly like
// `resolve-baseline.mjs`: a declined entry pointing at a deleted file is a
// failure, and the gate that fails on it is `check-upstream-briefs.mjs` in
// `tools/scripts/`, where the Meta-Gate can see it. This command reports the
// same condition so a developer meets it before CI does.
