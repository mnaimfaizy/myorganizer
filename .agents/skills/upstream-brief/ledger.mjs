/**
 * The ledger: what one Upstream Brief run remembers from the last one
 * (ADR 0084 items 11 and 12).
 *
 * Two kinds of memory live here, and they are the same kind of decision twice:
 *
 *   CARRY-FORWARD (item 11). The latest committed report for an Ecosystem is
 *   its ledger. A checked-and-clear Instruction Claim whose recorded range
 *   still covers the new Baseline, and whose quoted instruction text is
 *   unchanged at the current commit, is carried forward without new research.
 *   Everything else goes back on the research list. The brief then opens with
 *   a delta: findings that are new, findings the last run reported that are
 *   gone, and findings still present.
 *
 *   DECLINED OPPORTUNITIES (item 12). An Upstream Opportunity a human said no
 *   to is recorded in the adapter, and is suppressed while the Baseline stays
 *   in the range it was declined at and the upstream quote is unchanged. It
 *   resurfaces otherwise, because "no, not at 22" is not "no, forever".
 *
 * WHICH WAY EACH ONE FAILS, AND WHY THEY DIFFER
 *   A range this module cannot read fails **closed** for a carry-forward (the
 *   claim is researched again) and **open** for a decline (the Opportunity
 *   resurfaces). Those look opposite and are the same rule: when the ledger
 *   cannot say, the run does the work and the human sees the result. The
 *   expensive direction is the other one — a claim carried forward on a range
 *   nobody parsed, or an Opportunity silenced by an entry nobody could read.
 *
 * WHY THE RANGE GRAMMAR IS SMALL AND CLOSED
 *   `holdsFor` and a decline's Baseline range are compared against a version,
 *   so this module parses three forms and refuses everything else: an exact
 *   version (`16.2.6`), a wildcard tail (`22.x`, `0.80.x`), and a conjunction
 *   of comparators (`>=15.0.0 <17.0.0`). Caret and tilde are deliberately NOT
 *   accepted: `^0.2.3` means `>=0.2.3 <0.3.0` and `^1.2.3` means
 *   `>=1.2.3 <2.0.0`, and this repo's React Native Ecosystem sits on the 0.x
 *   line where that subtlety decides the answer. A range misread in that
 *   direction carries a claim forward that should have been re-researched,
 *   which is the one outcome the ledger exists to prevent — so an unrecognised
 *   spelling is refused by name rather than approximated.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE IMPORTS ONLY ITS SIBLINGS
 *   The skill is portable (ADR 0018, retained by ADR 0084). Every reader is
 *   injected, exactly as in `report.mjs` and `baseline.mjs`, so this module
 *   touches no filesystem and a caller may drive it from a worktree, a git
 *   object, or a fixture map. `report.test.mjs` asserts that import-freedom
 *   over every module in this directory, this one included.
 *
 *   The three things it does import from `report.mjs` — whitespace collapsing,
 *   version comparison, and local-evidence verification — are imported rather
 *   than re-implemented because the ledger's answer must agree with the
 *   contract's. "The quoted instruction text is unchanged" has to mean the
 *   same thing here as `text-differs` means there, or a claim could be carried
 *   forward on a quote the validator would refuse.

 * Apply the adapter's declined entries to the Opportunities one Ecosystem's
 * run produced (ADR 0084 item 12).
 *
 * Suppressed while **both** hold: the Baseline is still inside the range the
 * decline was made at, and the upstream quote still says what it said. Either
 * one moving brings the Opportunity back, because the human declined a
 * specific suggestion at a specific version, not the subject forever.
 *
 * An entry whose range this module cannot read suppresses nothing — see the
 * header: an unreadable decline must not be able to silence an Opportunity,
 * and the same string is a hard failure in `validateDeclinedOpportunities`, so
 * it cannot sit in an adapter unnoticed either.
 *
 * @param {object[]} opportunities this run's Opportunities for one Ecosystem
 * @param {object[]} entries the adapter's declined entries (all Ecosystems)
 * @param {{lead: string, baseline: string}} ecosystem
 * @returns {{kept: object[], suppressed: object[], resurfaced: object[]}}
 *   `kept` is what the run may still propose — every Opportunity that is not
 *   suppressed, resurfaced ones included. `resurfaced` is the subset of `kept`
 *   that a decline used to cover, each with the reason it came back.
