/**
 * The Baseline resolver (ADR 0084 items 1 and 2).
 *
 * Turns one Ecosystem declaration — a lead package name, plus companions an
 * adapter explicitly adds or removes — into what an Upstream Brief anchors
 * to: the lead's installed version (the Baseline), the full member list, and
 * drift notes for whoever keeps a version record honest (the dep-sync Skill).
 *
 * THREE VERSIONS, ONE OF WHICH THIS FILE TRUSTS
 *   A package can disagree with itself in three places: the *declared range*
 *   a manifest's `dependencies` field states (`^22.0.0`), the *version
 *   record* a repo keeps for humans (a tech-stack table), and the *installed*
 *   version an installed package's own manifest states. Only the installed
 *   version is the Baseline (ADR 0084 item 1) — a declared range is a
 *   promise, not a fact, and a version record is a document that drifts (the
 *   ADR's own example: recorded 22.3.3, installed 22.7.7). The other two are
 *   compared against, never read from: disagreement becomes a drift note,
 *   never a different Baseline.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE IMPORTS NOTHING
 *   The skill is portable (ADR 0018, retained by ADR 0084), like `report.mjs`
 *   beside it. Every version lookup and every membership discovery is
 *   injected as a function, so this module never touches a filesystem, and a
 *   caller supplies node_modules, a lockfile, or a fixture map identically.
 *   `.agents/skills/upstream-brief/report.test.mjs` asserts every module in
 *   this directory stays import-free of anything but Node built-ins and its
 *   own siblings, and that assertion already covers this file.
 *
 * MEMBERSHIP DISCOVERY
 *   A member is discovered by the lead's own npm scope convention: `nx` names
 *   companions under `@nx/*`; a lead already scoped (`@remix-run/react`)
 *   names companions under its own scope (`@remix-run/*`). An adapter
 *   Ecosystem declaration may `add` a companion the convention misses (an
 *   unscoped package, such as `eslint-config-next` beside `next`) or `remove`
 *   one that is installed but is not actually a companion.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED
 *   An Ecosystem whose lead is not installed has no installed version to
 *   anchor to, so it resolves to `{lead, ok: false, reason}` instead of
 *   guessing. That failure is scoped to its own Ecosystem — the rest still
 *   resolve.
