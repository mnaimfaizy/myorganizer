 * `_None._` rather than disappearing. A section that vanishes when it has
 * nothing in it reads as a section nobody ran; `_None._` is ADR 0084 item 8's
 * "zero is allowed and says what was considered", applied to every section.
 *
 * Imports nothing, for the reason written at the top of `report.mjs` beyond
 * the vocabularies it must share with the contract.
 *
 * SECTION ORDER IS THE CONTRACT. `BRIEF_SECTIONS` is the order, in one place,
 * and `render.test.mjs` asserts the rendered headings against it in sequence.
 * Two of the three briefs written under ADR 0018 invented a "checked and
 * clear" section the template lacked, which is what a fixed order is for.
