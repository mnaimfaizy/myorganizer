Committed eighth wave:

- `triage` (adapted from `mattpocock/skills`, with MyOrganizer issue/PR triage flow)

Committed ninth wave:

- `implement` (adapted from `mattpocock/skills`, with MyOrganizer delegation, validation, and commit/PR conventions)

Committed tenth wave:

- `create-hooks` (multi-harness Copilot / Cursor / Claude agent hooks)

Committed eleventh wave:

- `component-builder` (ComponentBuilder → ComponentReviewer; Structured Spec lives here, not in `AGENTS.md`)

These skills capture project-specific workflows that are easy for agents to miss even after reading the general repo instructions.

Note: these are VS Code workspace skills stored in `.agents/skills`. They are intended for agent discovery inside the editor. They may not appear in `npx skills list`, which focuses on skills installed through the `skills` CLI.

Third-party skills come in two scopes, and the scope decides everything (ADR 0030).

**Project scope** installs into this directory and is committed — an **Upstream-Owned Skill**. Never hand-edit one; refresh it with `npx skills update -p` and commit the diff. `skills-lock.json` is the registry, and `yarn skills:map:check` reads it to tell upstream-owned directories from repo-native ones. Four skills are in this tier: `codebase-design`, `handoff`, `modern-web-guidance`, `prototype`.

**Personal scope** is no longer approved. A skill on one developer's machine cannot be updated, reviewed, or vouched for by this repo, and the thirteen personal-scope recommendations went four months with nobody installing any of them while two died upstream (ADR 0032). For fast-moving framework knowledge, run `upstream-brief` — it audits repo-owned instructions against official docs for a named `subject@version` and keeps the result here, under review.

See `EXTERNAL_SKILLS.md` for the approved set.
