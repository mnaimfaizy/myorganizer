## What it is

MyOrganizer keeps the things you would rather not hand to a server — addresses, phone numbers,
subscriptions, tasks, groceries — in a vault that is encrypted and decrypted **in your browser**.
The key is derived from your passphrase and never leaves the device; the backend stores an opaque
blob it cannot read.

It is an Nx monorepo with three deployable apps: a Next.js web client, an Express API, and a React
Native mobile client that opens the same vault the browser wrote.

Three interactive pages explain the hard parts better than prose can. Open any of them in a
browser — no build step, no network, no server:

- **[Vault lifecycle](docs/vault/lifecycle.html)** — what happens over time, from creating a vault
  to restoring it on a new device.
- **[Vault trust boundary](docs/vault/trust-boundary.html)** — which zone holds keys, which holds
  only ciphertext, and what is allowed to cross.
- **[Session lifecycle](docs/authentication/session-lifecycle.html)** — one account from
  registration to revocation: which check rejects a login, and what "log everyone out" actually
  kills.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** Node.js ≥ 22, Yarn ≥ 4 via [Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html),
and Docker for local Postgres and MailHog.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mnaimfaizy/myorganizer.git
cd myorganizer
corepack enable
cp .env.example .env          # fill in database credentials and JWT secrets
corepack yarn install --immutable
docker-compose up -d          # Postgres + MailHog
yarn nx run backend:migrate
```

Then start the apps in separate terminals:

```sh
yarn start:backend       # http://localhost:3000 — API docs at /docs
yarn start:myorganizer   # http://localhost:4200
```

[DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) covers everything past this point: architecture, testing, running
the mobile app, and the agent workflows.

```

The web app enforces a strict thin-wrapper rule: `apps/myorganizer/src/app/**` holds routing,
metadata, and layout composition only, and every page's logic lives in `libs/web/pages/<route>/`.
Shared code belongs in `libs/**`, never in `apps/myorganizer/src/lib/**`.

## Where things are

This README is a front door, not a manual. Each of the files below is the single source of truth
