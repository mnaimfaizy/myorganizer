// Asserts that a shell command printed in a Markdown doc names files that exist.
//
//   node tools/scripts/check-doc-commands.mjs
//
// A documented command is a claim about the repository: "run this, against these files." The
// claim rots the ordinary way — a script is renamed, an input is never committed — and nothing
// notices, because prose is not executed. `docs/vault/README.md` advertised a rebuild of the
// vault pages from a `.dc.html` design export that has never existed in this repository, and the
// contradiction was found by a human following the instruction and failing (issue #534).
//
// This is an Assertion Gate in the sense of ADR 0043: it compares two artifacts — the paths a
// fenced command names, and the filesystem — and names the path that is wrong. It never asks
// whether a doc was touched.
//
// What it reads: every fenced `bash`/`sh`/`shell`/`console` block in every tracked `*.md`.
// What it asserts: a token that looks like a repo-relative path under a known top-level
// directory, or any token ending in `.dc.html`, resolves on disk.
//
// What it deliberately skips, and why:
//
//   - Placeholders. `<export-dir>`, `$BRANCH`, `*.spec.ts` are not claims about a file; they are
//     holes for the reader to fill. A checker that failed them would make every usage example
//     unwritable.
//   - Build outputs. A path git ignores is generated, so its absence in a clean tree is correct
//     rather than drift — `libs/web/ui/storybook-static` is documented and must stay documented.
//     Deferring to `.gitignore` keeps that judgement in one place instead of in an opt-out list
//     someone has to remember to prune.
//
// Exit 0 = every documented path resolves. Exit 1 = at least one does not. Exit 2 = cannot run.
