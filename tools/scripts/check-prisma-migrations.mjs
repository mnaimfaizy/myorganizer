// Until #748 nothing in .husky, .github/workflows, or the `gates:run` manifest
// read apps/backend/src/prisma/** as anything but source to reformat: the
// pre-commit hook runs `prisma format`, which rewrites the schema and asserts
// nothing. A broken migration therefore first failed on the shared host at
// deploy time, and release v0.4.0 shipped four migrations that were never
// applied at all (#437).
//
// This is the cheap half of the answer and it is deliberately narrow. It
// asserts only what can be read off the tree:
//
//   - every entry beside migration_lock.toml is a directory named
//     <14-digit timestamp>_<lowercase_snake_slug>, the shape
//     `prisma migrate dev` writes and `prisma migrate deploy` sorts by;
//   - no two migrations share a timestamp, because two branches that each
//     wrote one never conflict in git and the engine's order then depends on
//     which name sorts first (the same hazard ADR 0042 records for ADR
//     numbers);
//   - every migration directory carries a migration.sql holding at least one
//     statement once SQL comments are stripped, because an empty or
//     comment-only migration.sql applies silently and records itself as
//     applied, which is indistinguishable afterwards from having run;
//   - no other .sql file sits in a migration directory, because the engine
//     reads migration.sql and nothing else, so a second file is SQL somebody
//     wrote that will never run;
//   - migration_lock.toml exists and its provider agrees with the schema's
//     datasource provider, since a mismatch makes the engine refuse the whole
//     history at deploy time. `postgres` and `postgresql` are the same
//     provider spelled two ways — the schema says one, the lock file says the
//     other — so they are normalized rather than compared literally.
//
// What it deliberately does NOT assert, because every one of these needs a
// database and this checker runs in the pre-commit aggregate: that the SQL
// parses, that the history applies cleanly to an empty database, or that
// applying it reproduces the schema. Those are the expensive half, and they
// are asserted by the `prisma-migrations` job in .github/workflows/ci.yml
// against an ephemeral Postgres service. Passing this check is not evidence
// that a migration works; it is evidence that the history is well-formed
// enough for the job that decides whether it works to be able to run it.
//
// Exit 0 = the history is well-formed. Exit 1 = drift, naming each migration
// and what is wrong with it. Exit 2 = the check could not run.
