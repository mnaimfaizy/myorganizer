// Asserts that the standalone Escape Copy reader still opens a freshly
// produced envelope, and still needs nothing of ours to do it (ADR 0064).
//
//   node tools/scripts/check-escape-copy-reader.mjs
//
// ADR 0064 decides two things this checks. That an Escape Copy is readable by
// a tool requiring no MyOrganizer server, no session and no Google account —
// and that a gate asserts the tool still opens a freshly produced envelope,
// because "a reader pinned to a schema version the exporter has moved past is
// worse than no reader: it fails at the only moment anyone runs it, and it
// fails silently until then".
//
// Five things are asserted, and none of them is a file comparison:
//
//   1. **The exporter's output opens.** The envelope is produced here and now
//      by `exportVault` — the function the Export button and the Drive backup
//      both call — never read from a fixture, which would only ever be as
//      current as the last person to remember it. The reader must yield back
//      the exact plaintext that went in, for every Vault Blob Type, under
//      both a passphrase and a Recovery Key — and must refuse a wrong one,
//      because a reader that yields nothing reads to a User as an empty vault.
//   2. **The reader was built for the schema the exporter is producing.** One
//      comparison, and it is ADR 0064 decision 2 whole.
//   3. **The reader is whole.** Every CSS custom property it uses is one it
//      also defines. A `var(--name)` naming nothing takes its fallback, which
//      makes the token indirection decoration over a hard-coded literal — and
//      it renders correctly while doing so, which is why nobody sees it.
//   4. **The reader needs nothing of ours.** The built page is searched for
//      any way to reach the network — `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`, `WebSocket`,
//      `navigator.sendBeacon`, `EventSource`, a dynamic `import()` — for an
//      external `src`/`href`, and for browser storage, which a page holding
//      somebody's vault passphrase has no business touching. A reader that
//      phones home is not an escape hatch, and the property is invisible until
//      the day it matters.
//   5. **The published checksum is the checksum of the published file**, and
//      every place that names those files names the ones the build publishes —
//      the vault page's constants, which is what the in-product prompt tells a
//      User to download, and the reader's own page, which tells them which
//      checksum file to compare against. The number a User is told to verify
//      has to be a number this build produces, and the file they are told to
//      fetch has to be one that is there, or checking teaches them to stop.
//
// What runs is the **built artifact**, not the source: the HTML is built, its
// inlined script is evaluated in a bare Node context with Web Crypto and no
// DOM, and the envelope is opened through the handle that script exposes. An
// assertion against the sources would pass while the thing we publish is
// broken, which is the failure mode ADR 0043 is about.
//
// The judgments themselves live in tools/scripts/lib/escape-copy-reader-gate.mjs
// so the contract suite can exercise each one against a fixture instead of
// building a 500 KB page per assertion; this file is IO.
//
// Not asserted: that the page *renders*. The DOM glue is covered by
// `apps/escape-copy-reader`'s jsdom suite; running a browser here would cost
// more than it buys and would not make the crypto any more opened.
//
// Exit 0 = the reader opens what the exporter produces. Exit 1 = it does not,
// or it gained a capability it must not have. Exit 2 = the check could not run.
