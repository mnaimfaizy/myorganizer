// Asserts the committed mobile app icon outputs are what
// `yarn mobile:app-icon:generate` would write from the current BrandMark
// shield and design-token build, naming each output that is missing or stale.
//
//   node tools/scripts/check-mobile-app-icon.mjs
//
// The icons ship inside the native projects, so a changed shield or Brand
// Primitive without a re-run leaves the installed app wearing the old mark,
// and nothing in review shows it. This builds every output in memory through
// the generator's own module (tools/scripts/lib/mobile-app-icon.mjs).
//
// Directions:
// - Sources → text outputs, exactly: the SVG masters, the Android vector
//   drawables, the launcher background colour, the adaptive-icon entries,
//   and the iOS Contents.json. Between them they carry every value the icon
//   reads — the shield and check paths, the stroke width, each colour, and the
//   layout — so a source change without a re-run fails here.
// - Sources → PNGs, existence only. The PNGs are not compared: they are
//   rasterised through Chromium, and this gate runs in the pre-commit
//   aggregate, which reads files and does not launch a browser. They are
//   rasterised from the same SVGs in the same run that writes the text
//   outputs, so they go stale only alongside them, or by hand. (Chromium did
//   reproduce every committed PNG byte for byte on macOS arm64 and Linux x64
//   when this gate was added, #1135; that is why a re-run leaves no diff, not
//   something this gate relies on.)
// - Not asserted: that every file under the native projects' icon folders is
//   a generated output. Those folders belong to the native projects, and an
//   extra file there is not drift from the shield or the tokens.
//
// Exit 0 = every output matches. Exit 1 = an output is missing or stale.
// Exit 2 = the check could not run (a source value could not be read).
