/**
 * Whether a finding's executed evidence is something the reviewer transcript
 * shows was run (issue #1039, ADR 0126).
 *
 * A finding with `evidence.kind: "executed"` names a command and an exit
 * code, and that evidence can earn Blocking (ADR 0071). Both are written by
 * the model that claims to have run it. The transcript holds every Bash call
 * that was actually made, so the two are compared here.
 *
 * This module compares and reports. What a mismatch costs is decided in
 * `run-ladder.mjs`.
 *
 * ## The matching rule
 *
 * A model quoting a command it ran rarely quotes it byte for byte, and a
 * check that fails a pull request on a stray space would be re-run, not
 * read. So the comparison is on what ran, not on how it was typed. The
 * evidence matches a call when, after the four allowances below, every
 * simple command the evidence quotes is one the call ran, adjacent and in
 * the call's order.
 *
 *   1. **Whitespace.** A command is compared as its words. Any run of
 *      unquoted whitespace separates two words and is otherwise nothing, and
 *      a backslash at the end of a line continues the command.
 *   2. **Quoting.** Quotes and backslash escapes are taken off and what they
 *      held stays one word: `"old name"`, `'old name'`, and `old\ name` are
 *      the same word, and `--x="a b"` is the same word as `--x='a b'`.
 *      Quoting that changes the words is a different command: `old name`
 *      unquoted is two words.
 *   3. **One part of a chained call.** A call is split at `&&`, `||`, `;`,
 *      `|`, and a newline into its simple commands. Evidence may quote the
 *      whole call, one of its simple commands, or several adjacent ones:
 *      `yarn nx test backend` matches `cd apps/backend && yarn nx test
 *      backend | tail -n 40`. Parts taken from two different calls, parts
 *      out of order, and parts with one skipped between them do not match.
 *      Which separator joined them is not compared. A call that holds a
 *      here-document is the exception: its body is text that reads as
 *      commands, so it matches whole or not at all.
 *   4. **Where it ran and where its output went.** An unquoted redirection
 *      (`2>&1`, `> file`, `2>/dev/null`, `< file`, `<<< text`) is dropped
 *      with its target from both sides, and so is a trailing `&`.
 *
 * Nothing else is allowed. `yarn nx test x` is not `corepack yarn nx test
 * x`, an added or dropped flag is a different command, and a prefix of a
 * command is not the command. Evidence that comes to no words at all matches
 * nothing: an empty sequence would otherwise be found in every call.
 *
 * The words are compared as typed. Nothing is expanded: a variable, a glob,
 * a `$(…)` substitution, and a subshell's parentheses are the characters
 * they are, on both sides. A command inside a substitution is therefore not
 * a part evidence can quote on its own.
 *
 * ## The exit code
 *
 * The transcript carries one exit code per call, not per simple command, so
 * it is compared only when the evidence quotes the whole call and the
 * transcript carries a code for that call. Evidence that is one part of a
 * chained call has no code of its own in the transcript, and a call with no
 * readable result has none either. Both are "cannot tell", and "cannot tell"
 * matches. A command run more than once matches if any run agrees.
