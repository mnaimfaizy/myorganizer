/**
 * The rule catalogue: the bounded vocabulary a `/code-review` finding names as
 * the rule it applies (issue #724).
 *
 * A finding's identity has to be stable across runs and has to discriminate.
 * Free-form `rule` prose was stable at neither — the model reworded it every
 * run, so 38 of 38 consecutive reports persisted nothing (issue #718) — and
 * dropping it left `axis + source + file`, where one source (`smell-baseline`)
 * covered twelve separate rules and two distinct defects in one file collided.
 * A closed list the reviewer *selects* from is stable like an enum and
 * discriminates like prose, which is what this file is.
 *
 * Five families, each bounded by something that already exists:
 *
 *   smell          the twelve Fowler smells the Standards brief pastes in full
 *                  (`Refactoring`, ch. 3). Capped at should-fix, because a
 *                  smell is a judgement call (ADR 0071 item 1).
 *   obligation     one per entry of `tools/config/review-obligations.json`,
 *                  the machine form of the Review Checklist. Ids are that
 *                  catalogue's ids with an `obligation-` prefix, and the gate
 *                  asserts the two lists stay equal.
 *   reach-through  the two checks the Standards brief runs against the whole
 *                  tree rather than the diff.
 *   standard       one per documented repo standard the reviewer applies.
 *                  Every entry `cites` the document that holds the rule, and
 *                  the gate asserts that document exists.
 *   spec           the three defect kinds the Spec brief asks for: a
 *                  requirement missing, behaviour nobody asked for, a
 *                  requirement implemented wrong.
 *
 * `standard-other` is the one fallback, and it is deliberate. A reviewer that
 * cannot name its finding has to be able to file it anyway: the record here is
 * that a report nobody writes costs more than a coarse one — golden replay run
 * 45 spent 26 of 81 turns on refused commands and produced no report at all
 * (docs/research/2026-09-10-the-answer-sheet-is-inert.md). A fallback finding
 * keeps the pre-#724 identity behaviour (coarse tuple, disambiguated within a
 * report by line order) and is a standing request for a catalogue entry.
 *
 * Everything here is pure except `loadRuleCatalogue`, which reads the file.
 * Cross-file agreement — obligation ids, cited documents, the ids the skill
 * pastes into the reviewer's prompt — is asserted by
 * `tools/scripts/check-review-rules.mjs`, not here.
