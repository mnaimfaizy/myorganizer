// Validates a `/code-review` report and writes its normalized form (ADR 0071).
//
//   node tools/scripts/review/validate-review-report.mjs <report.json>
//     [--out <normalized.json>] [--tier <review:label>] [--previous <normalized.json>]
//     [--facts <run-facts.json>] [--worklist <obligations.json>]
//
// A report is accepted whole or rejected whole. On rejection every schema
// issue is printed, one per line, and nothing is written — a partial verdict
// is the thing this script exists to refuse. The normalized file carries the
// derived finding ids, the computed verdict, and the effective tier; it is
// what the renderer and the poster read.
//
// --previous is the previous run's normalized report. A finding that report
// already held — same axis, rule id, and file, on overlapping lines — keeps
// its id; every other finding is minted one (ADR 0071 item 6, issue #940).
// It is how a finding is recognised across pushes, so a run that has a
// previous report and is not handed it reads every finding as new. A report
// of another schema version lends no ids and is not an error.
//
// --facts is the run facts file `read-transcript-facts.mjs` wrote from the
// reviewer transcript. It overwrites the report's `standardsSources`,
// `executed`, `durationMs`, and `model`, which are facts about the run and
// not the reviewer's to state (ADR 0123). Without it the report keeps what
// the reviewer wrote and is marked `runFactsFrom: reviewer`.
//
// With --facts the run is also judged (run-ladder.mjs). A fact that fails
// `Agent Review Ran` — no sub-agent read an axis's brief, or a reported
// finding is not one a sub-agent returned — is written to
// `runFacts.failures` and printed; a fact that tightens the tier is written
// to `runFacts.tightenedBy` and moves `effectiveTier`. Neither rejects the
// report: it met its contract, and the caller fails the check from the
// normalized file, so the findings are still published.
//
// --worklist is the obligation worklist the selector wrote. It is read for
// one thing: which findings the main agent was meant to write itself, which
// no sub-agent returned and which are not a failure. A path that does not
// exist is a run with no worklist, as it is everywhere else in the pipeline.
//
// Exit 0 = valid, normalized report written or printed.
// Exit 1 = invalid report (the reviewer's output does not meet the contract).
// Exit 2 = the script could not run (missing file, unreadable JSON, a
//          --previous of this schema version that is not a normalized report,
//          a --facts that is not a run facts file, or a --worklist that
//          exists and is not JSON).
