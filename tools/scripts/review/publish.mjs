/**
 * What the CI review workflow posts, decided as pure functions so the
 * contract tests never touch GitHub (ADR 0070 item 8: a script posts, the
 * reviewer never holds a token). `publish-review-report.mjs` is the only
 * file that calls `gh`.
 *
 * The publisher behaves like a human reviewer would, not like a dashboard:
 *
 *   1. Every run posts a new summary comment. The previous run's summary is
 *      never deleted or rewritten; it is marked outdated (GitHub's
 *      "minimize" with classifier OUTDATED), so the history of what the
 *      reviewer said about each head stays readable in the thread.
 *   2. Inline comments go on blocking findings that carry a location, once
 *      per finding id while a thread for that id is still open. A finding
 *      that disappears from the report resolves its thread; a finding that
 *      comes back after being resolved gets a fresh comment.
 *   3. The label. ADR 0069 item 1: a blocking finding relabels an `auto` or
 *      `agent` Pull Request to `review:human`; no spec source does the same
 *      (`effectiveTier`). The label never loosens here — only the classifier
 *      lowers a tier, and only on a fresh run.
