 * carrying its own verdict is rejected, because a verdict is computed, never
 * written.

 * have no lines to compare, so they pair off by the match fields alone, in
 * report order — the residue issue #940 leaves, as it was before.
 *
 * The two ranges are line numbers in two different commits, and nothing here
 * maps one onto the other. A push that moves a defect clear of the lines it
 * was reported at therefore reads as that finding gone and a new one raised.
 * That is the cheap direction to be wrong in — a repost of feedback still on
 * the report, not feedback lost — and across the 2026-10-05 window raw
 * overlap recognised 17 of the 19 located findings that genuinely persisted.
