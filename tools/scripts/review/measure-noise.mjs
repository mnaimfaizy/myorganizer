// The evidence is the review's own stored artifacts. Every run of the Code
// Review workflow uploads the normalized report it validated
// (`code-review-normalized`, retained 30 days), so the reviewer's history on
// a branch is a sequence of reports, one per reviewed push — which is what
// makes "still there on the next push" a fact rather than an impression.
// `gh` supplies the runs and the artifacts; git supplies the commit messages
// between two pushes, where an optional `Review-ack:` marker takes a finding
// out of the numerator.
//
// What could not be read is reported and never assumed: a push with no
// artifact makes the findings before it `unreadable`, a pair spanning a
// report schema bump is `incomparable`, and both are counted in the ledger
// rather than dropped from it.
//
// Not a gate. It reports a rate over stored history, has no fact to fail on
// for the commit in front of it, and reaches the network; it carries a
// written opt-out in tools/config/gate-coverage-optout.json.
