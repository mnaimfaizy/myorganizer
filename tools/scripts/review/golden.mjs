/**
 * The golden set (ADR 0071, Consequences): incidents the repo already paid
 * for, written as the findings a reviewer should have raised, so a change to
 * the skill, the schema, the validator, the renderer, or the workflow can be
 * replayed against them before it reaches a Pull Request.
 *
 * A case names a real commit range from this repository's history and the
 * findings expected in a report about that range. An expected finding is
 * axis, source, rule, and file, where source and rule are patterns and file
 * is a set: the reviewer phrases a rule in the source's words, and the same
 * defect is fairly located at more than one of the files involved. `rule` is
 * a matching pattern only — it left the identity tuple in issue #718 because
 * the reviewer rewords it every run. Matching stays on those patterns: a case
 * is a historical measurement, and tightening it to one exact id would score
 * a reviewer that named the defect defensibly differently as a miss.
 *
 * The strict-tuple annotation is the part that must track the tuple, because
 * it claims the reviewer named the finding exactly: the same axis, rule id,
 * and file — the fields two findings must share to be one. An expectation
 * says whether it is literal enough to be a tuple by pinning `ruleId` to one
 * catalogue id (issue #724); an expectation that pins none is simply never
 * strict. The line a finding starts at is in a minted id since issue #940 and
 * is no part of this: no expectation can know it. Recall is matched over
 * expected.
 *
 * A case may instead be clean-diff (issue #933): a known-good merged Pull
 * Request that measures false alarms rather than recall. It carries
 * `expectsNoBlocking: true` and a `why` explaining what makes it a clean
 * choice — no later fix names it as root cause and its own review raised no
 * Blocking finding — in place of `expected` and `minRecall`, which the set
 * measures recall from and which a clean case has none of: there is nothing
 * to recall when nothing should have been found. `scoreCase` reports it as
 * `clean-pass` or `clean-fail`, never as a recall number, because averaging a
 * pass/fail measurement into a recall fraction would hide which kind failed.
 *
 * Everything here is pure; `score-golden-case.mjs` reads files and exits.
