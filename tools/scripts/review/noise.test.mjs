/**
 * The effective-false-positive measurement (issue #729): what a finding did
 * between two pushes, and what that does to its rule's rate.
 *
 * The three cases the issue names — acted on, ignored, excluded by the
 * marker — are the first three tests. The rest defend the classes that keep
 * the denominator auditable: a finding with no next push, a push with no
 * report, and a pair spanning a schema bump are each set aside by name
