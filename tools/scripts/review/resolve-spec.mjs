// Order is the skill's: the branch name (`<type>/<issue>-<slug>`), then an
// issue reference in a commit subject or body, otherwise `none`. The issue
// is fetched with `gh issue view` and written beside the resolved source:
//
//   { "spec": { "kind": "issue", "ref": "#123", "foundBy": "branch" },
//     "title": "...", "body": "..." }
//
// A change answers to every issue its commits close, not only the one that
// was found first (ADR 0125). Each further issue a commit closes is named in
// `spec.also` and fetched the same way:
//
//   { "spec": { "kind": "issue", "ref": "#123", "foundBy": "branch",
//               "also": ["#124"] },
//     "title": "...", "body": "...",
//     "also": [{ "ref": "#124", "title": "...", "body": "..." }] }
//
// Every body is untrusted text (ADR 0071 item 4); it is written verbatim for
// the reviewer to quote, never interpreted here.
//
// The pull request body is deliberately NOT a source here: on agent-authored
// work it is the author's own summary of the diff, so the Spec axis would be
// checking the diff against itself (ADR 0076). Branches whose names carry no
// issue number — `feat/<prd-slug>`, `claude/…`, `copilot/…` — carry it in
// their first commit instead, which the commit step below already reads.
//
// Exit 0 = written (a `none` spec is a valid result). Exit 2 = could not run.
