 * Three readers need these and must not each keep a copy:
 * `check-review-rules.mjs` asserts the brief files against the rule catalogue
 * and the skill against the template, and `transcript-facts.mjs` recognises
 * an axis's dispatch in a reviewer transcript by them. A template the skill
 * states one way and the transcript reader expects another would report every
 * correct dispatch as steered.
 *
 * Keyed by finding axis. `satisfies` is not available in a .mjs file, so
 * `check-review-rules.mjs` asserts the keys against `FINDING_AXES`.
