/**
 * What a reviewer transcript says about the run that produced a report
 * (issue #1031, ADR 0123).
 *
 * A report used to state these facts about itself: which standards documents
 * the review was held to, which commands it ran, how long it took, which
 * model ran it. Each was written by the model being described, and CI run
 * 37576528356 listed four standards sources having opened none. They are
 * read here instead, from the transcript `anthropics/claude-code-action`
 * leaves behind, after the reviewer has exited.
 *
 * This module reads and reports. It fails nothing and tightens nothing: what
 * a fact costs is decided in `run-ladder.mjs`, from the facts file.
 *
 * The transcript's shape belongs to the Claude Code CLI, which this
 * repository does not version. So "cannot tell" is its own answer: a
 * transcript that does not look the way this reader expects is `unknown`,
 * never an empty list. Read naively, a CLI release that renamed one field
 * would report "no sub-agent read its brief" on every pull request.
