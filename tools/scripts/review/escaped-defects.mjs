/**
 * The escaped-defect measurement (issue #721, PRD #713): **of the Pull
 * Requests the reviewer passed, what fraction a later fix names as root
 * cause.**
 *
 * Golden recall (`golden.mjs`) runs the archaeology in the other direction —
 * a curated incident is traced back to the Pull Request that introduced it,
 * and the reviewer is replayed against that range. That is a regression
 * signal and explicitly not a trust measure: the cases are hand-picked, the
 * reviewer has seen them, and nothing about the score says whether a human
 * can rely on a passing review today. This module turns the archaeology
 * around and reads the repository's own fix history instead.
 *
 * Three distinctions carry the whole measurement, and collapsing any of them
 * would produce a number that flatters the reviewer:
 *
 *   1. **Passed is not the same as seen.** A Pull Request merged before the
 *      reviewer existed, or one whose review produced no verdict, is not an
 *      escaped defect — nothing passed it. Those are counted in their own
 *      buckets and never in the numerator.
 *   2. **Blocked is not escaped.** If the reviewer asked for changes and the
 *      work merged anyway, the reviewer did its job and a human overrode it.
 *      That is worth knowing and is not a miss.
 *   3. **Unattributable is counted, not dropped.** A fix that names no root
 *      cause tells us nothing about the reviewer, but silently discarding it
 *      would leave a denominator nobody can audit. Every fix in the window
 *      lands in exactly one class.
 *
 * Everything here is pure. `measure-escaped-defects.mjs` reads git, calls
 * `gh`, and exits.
