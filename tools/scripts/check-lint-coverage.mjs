//   node tools/scripts/check-lint-coverage.mjs [graphFile] [workspaceRoot]
//
// CI (`nx affected -t lint`) and `.husky/pre-commit` both select targets *named*
// `lint`. A project whose ESLint target carries any other name is not failed by
// those gates — it is skipped, and the run goes green because the project is
// invisible. That is how `libs/auth`, `libs/email-shell`, `tools`, `apps/mobile`,
// and `apps/myorganizer-e2e` went unlinted from the day each was created: an
// `@nx/eslint/plugin` rename to `targetName: "eslint:lint"`, carried into the
// repo unremarked by an unrelated feature PR (issue #426).
//
// Fixing `nx.json` closed that instance. This is the standing assertion, because
// the failure is silent by construction: nothing about a green pipeline
// distinguishes "linted and clean" from "never looked at".
//
// A project is in scope if EITHER holds:
//
//   a. Nx reports an ESLint-backed target for it, under any name.
//   b. Its root carries an `eslint.config.*`.
//
// (b) is not redundant. An explicit `project.json` target *replaces* the
// inferred one of the same name rather than merging with it, so a project whose
// `lint` runs something other than ESLint has no ESLint target left in the graph
// at all — it would satisfy (a) vacuously. Reading the config off disk is what
// makes the shadowing case detectable.
//
// For every project in scope, `lint` must exist and must run ESLint.
//
// Out of scope: projects with neither signal. `api-specs` and `app-api-client`
// name a `lint` target that verifies OpenAPI artifacts instead; generated output
// is exempt from ESLint on purpose, and neither carries a config, so neither is
// a finding.
//
// Known gap: a project with no local `eslint.config.*` that inherits the root
// config AND declares a non-ESLint `lint` target is invisible to both signals.
// No project is in that shape today; closing it would mean resolving ESLint's
// own config cascade per project, which costs more than it currently buys.
//
// Exit 0 = every lintable project is in the gate. Exit 1 = drift. Exit 2 = the
// check could not run.
