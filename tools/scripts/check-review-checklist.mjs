// elsewhere is the shape this repo already gates everywhere else
// (vault:pages:check, auth:pages:check, review:pages:check,
// deploy:pages:check). Without this checker an obligation's id or its
// answerFields can move in the JSON while the entry a human reads still
// describes the old one, and the file's own claim — one artifact, two
// readers — quietly stops being true.
//
// What is asserted is what is mechanical: the set and order of ids, each
// entry's answer fields, and which of those fields must quote a line of
// source. The rationale, the trigger prose, and the incident history are
// deliberately not asserted; they are writing, and a gate over writing is a
// gate nobody can satisfy.
