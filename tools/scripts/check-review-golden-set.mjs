// Asserts that tools/config/review-golden-set.json is a golden set the
// replay can run (ADR 0071, Consequences).
//
//   node tools/scripts/check-review-golden-set.mjs
//
// Four things rot here and each is checked: the set's shape (ids, SHAs,
// patterns, minimum recall), the commit ranges (both ends must exist, an
// attributed head must be reachable from main and a seeded head from its
// golden/ tag, or the replay reviews nothing — ADR 0129),
// and the replay workflow's triggers, which must be the ones ADR 0109 names —
// a weekly schedule that asks which reviewer inputs moved, the golden-replay
// Request Label, and dispatch — and never a push to a Pull Request, which
// bought most of three weeks' replay spend on runs nobody asked to measure.
// Which inputs the schedule watches is REPLAY_INPUT_PATHS in golden-tiers.mjs,
// covered by its own tests.
// And the replay checks the reviewer's obligation answer sheet before it
// scores, as production does, or a run production would fail as a pipeline
// fault is recorded as a miss (ADR 0101).
// And it reads the run failures the validator recorded before it scores,
// and hands the normalized report to the recorder: a review that did not run
// as built is a void, and every line carries the Claude Code CLI version and
// the run facts that tighten a tier in production (ADR 0123 item 7).
// And the repeat count: the scheduled replay runs each case standing at
// frontier three times and every other case once, a label or a dispatch runs
// every case once, and the workflow asks for that matrix and keeps each
// repetition's result apart (ADR 0116).
// And a Spec-axis case replays with the spec its original review saw: the step
// writing spec.json reads the case's specSnapshot, and that job's checkout
// keeps full history so a seeded case's golden tag is in the clone (ADR 0129).
//
// One direction throughout: the set, the record and the ADRs are the
// sources, and the workflow is what is held to them.
//
// Exit 0 = sound. Exit 1 = findings. Exit 2 = could not run.
