// Re-validates every committed structured Upstream Brief report (ADR 0084 item 10).
//
//   node tools/scripts/check-upstream-briefs.mjs [--print]
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL, GIVEN THE VALIDATOR IS ELSEWHERE
//   The validator ships inside `.agents/skills/upstream-brief/` because the
//   skill is portable and a validator in this repo's script tree would make a
//   brief checkable only here (ADR 0018, retained by ADR 0084). But
//   `gates:coverage:check` — the Meta-Gate — discovers checkers by a
//   NON-RECURSIVE scan of `tools/scripts/` for `check-*.mjs`
//   (`tools/scripts/lib/gate-coverage.mjs`). A gate living anywhere else is
//   invisible to it: it would look wired forever, and deleting the line that
//   runs it would fail nothing. So this file is a thin adapter, named and
//   placed to be seen, and the judgment stays in the skill.
//
// WHAT IT ASSERTS, AND IN WHICH DIRECTION
//   Two assertions about two artifacts, each one direction.
//
//   1. THE COMMITTED REPORTS, AT THE COMMIT THEY RECORD. For every structured
//   report committed in the brief directory, every entry that survived
//   validation still holds at the commit that report records. A local citation
//   is `file` + `line` + the literal text at that line, read back with
//   `git show <commit>:<file>`. Because the commit is fixed, a brief frozen at
//   its date stays valid however far the tree moves on — and a citation that
//   stops matching means the report and the history disagree, which is drift a
//   frozen document cannot self-report.
//
//   The other direction is deliberately NOT asserted: nothing here requires a
//   Markdown brief to have a structured report beside it. The three briefs
//   written before ADR 0084 are not migrated (ADR 0084, Consequences), so a
//   rule of that shape would fail on three documents nobody intends to change.
//   A brief directory holding no structured report passes, and says so.
//
//   2. THE ADAPTER'S DECLINED OPPORTUNITIES, AT THE CURRENT TREE (ADR 0084
//   item 12: "The validator fails an entry whose Ecosystem or path no longer
//   exists"). A declined entry is a standing instruction to stay quiet about
//   one technique at one place. When the Ecosystem is no longer declared or
//   the file is gone, the entry silences nothing and records a decision about
//   something that is not there. Unlike the reports above, this one is about
//   the tree in front of it: a decline is live configuration, not a frozen
//   document, and the question is whether it still points at anything today.
//
//   Its other direction is deliberately NOT asserted either: nothing here
//   requires a declined entry to name an Opportunity any run actually
//   produced. Suppression is decided at run time against the Baseline and the
//   upstream quote (`ledger.mjs`), and a gate that demanded a live match would
//   fail on exactly the entry doing its job — the one whose Opportunity is no
//   longer being proposed because it is suppressed.
//
//   Nor does it re-check the report's own `unverified` list. Those entries
//   were refused at write time and carry no surviving claim; re-checking them
//   would fail forever by construction and no brief could pass its own gate.
//
// WHICH FILES ARE REPORTS
//   Every `*.json` directly in the brief directory. Not a filename pattern:
//   a report that escaped the gate through a typo'd name is exactly the
//   failure mode the Meta-Gate exists to prevent, one level down. The scan is
//   non-recursive, matching `check-docs-notes.mjs`, so a brief that needs an
//   assets folder is unaffected — and a JSON file in the brief directory that
//   is not a report belongs in a subdirectory of it.
//
// Exit 0 = every committed report still holds (or there are none), and every
//          declined Opportunity still points at something real.
// Exit 1 = a report is invalid, or its local evidence no longer matches the
//          commit it records, or a declined entry names an Ecosystem or a path
//          that is gone.
// Exit 2 = the check could not run: an unreadable report, or a recorded commit
//          this clone does not have. The second is separated deliberately —
//          `git show` fails identically for a missing path and an unresolvable
//          ref, so without resolving the commit first a shallow clone would
//          report every citation in the brief as a fabrication (ADR 0078).
