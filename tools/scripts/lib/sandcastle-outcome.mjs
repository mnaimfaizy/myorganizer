 * Whether a finished slice run is clean enough to close (ADR 0111).

 * In PRD mode a slice that produced commits is always integrated and marked
 * `status:done` (ADR 0045) — that is what keeps a re-run from dispatching it
 * twice. Closing it, and unblocking the slices that depend on it, is a stronger
 * claim: that the slice is finished. Mobile v1 made that claim for every slice
 * that committed anything, while the agents' own output said otherwise —
 * "## Not delivered — keep-awake", a last review verdict of request-changes, a
 * run that never signalled completion. This module reads that output and
 * decides.
 *
 * Pure: it takes the log text and returns a verdict, so the rules are tested
 * without a sandbox, a network, or GitHub.
