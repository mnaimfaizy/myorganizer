/**
 * The one glob→RegExp compiler for the tooling in tools/scripts.
 *
 * It existed twice: once for the Review Tier classifier and once, written
 * again, for the obligation selector. The copies disagreed. `libs/**\/x.ts`
 * matched `libs/ax.ts` in the second, because it consumed the separator
 * after `**` without putting one back, and `?` was a literal there and a
 * wildcard here. A glob moved between the two catalogues therefore changed
 * meaning, and a fix to one copy left the other wrong — so both now import
 * this.
 *
 * The syntax: `**` spans directories, `*` and `?` stay inside one segment,
 * everything else is literal. Patterns match the whole path.
 *
 * @param {string} glob
 * @returns {RegExp}
