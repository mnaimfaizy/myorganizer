// The spec anchor: how a branch whose NAME carries no issue number still tells
// the code review which issue it answers to.
//
// `/code-review` resolves its spec source in a fixed order — branch name, then
// an issue reference in a commit, then nothing (tools/scripts/review/
// resolve-spec.mjs). A sandcastle PRD integration branch is `feat/<prd-slug>`:
// the slug is the PRD's title, not its number, so the branch-name step cannot
// match and the pull request opened from it reaches the reviewer with no spec.
// That drops the effective tier one level on exactly the work a human most
// needs the Spec axis to cover — agent-authored.
//
// The fix stays inside the existing discovery order: the orchestrator writes an
// empty first commit on the branch it creates, carrying a closing reference the
// commit step already reads. Nothing about resolve-spec.mjs changes. See
// ADR 0076.
//
// A pull request body is deliberately NOT a spec source, so this cannot be
// solved by having the agent describe its own work — see the same ADR.
