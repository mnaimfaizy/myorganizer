/**
 * The decision behind `checker-contracts:check`
 * (`tools/scripts/check-checker-contracts.mjs`): a ratchet holding
 * contract-suite coverage for `tools/scripts/check-*.mjs` checkers to a fixed
 * baseline, so the count of untested checkers can only shrink (ADR 0085).
 *
 * ADR 0085's finding is that "state your direction in the header" is not
 * enough — `check-readme.mjs` stated its direction in exactly the fixed form
 * the convention asked for and still had it wrong, because nothing made the
 * claim true. A contract suite is what makes it true. This checker does not
 * grade what a suite asserts; it asserts only that one exists, the same way
 * `check-lint-coverage.mjs` asserts a source file has *a* test, not that the
 * test is any good.
 *
 * Coverage is file adjacency: `tools/scripts/check-x.mjs` "has a contract
 * suite" iff `tools/scripts/check-x.test.mjs` exists. This is the same
 * convention the rest of the checkers already use for their own tests, and
 * it is what `--test` filters on in `tools/scripts/lib/gate-coverage.mjs`.
 *
 * A baseline entry is keyed by the checker's own path — one string, one
 * checker — because unlike `nx-declared-targets-baseline.json` there is no
 * composite fact to key on: a checker either has a suite or it does not.
 * `compareBaseline` reports `missing` (a checker with no suite and no
 * baseline entry — new, untracked debt) and `stale` (a baseline entry naming
 * a checker that is no longer debt, whether because it gained a suite or
 * because the checker itself is gone). Both directions are asserted; neither
 * is omitted, which is the header claim this file's own contract suite
 * (`tools/scripts/check-checker-contracts.test.mjs`) proves true.
 *
 * Deliberately no written-reason opt-out list, unlike
 * `tools/config/gate-coverage-optout.json`. ADR 0085 rejects "not worth
 * testing" as a per-checker judgment call — that is exactly the discretion
 * the baseline exists to remove. Debt is recorded, not excused.
