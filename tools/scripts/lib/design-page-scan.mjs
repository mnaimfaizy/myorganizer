/**
 * Mechanical checks for House Explainer Pages — the self-contained HTML artifacts
 * the Designer sub-agent produces (`.github/agents/designer.agent.md`).
 *
 * This module is pure: every filesystem fact it needs is passed in. The CLI that
 * reads those facts is `tools/scripts/check-design-hygiene.mjs`.
 *
 * Each rule here exists because a real dispatch got it wrong, and because a model
 * asked to confirm "the page has no root-svg <title>" will glance at it and say
 * yes. See docs/adr/0046-house-explainer-pages-have-a-designer-and-a-gate.md.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT checked here — judgment, and the reason a human still reads
 * the page: whether the hero is the right hero, whether a panel earns its place,
 * whether the prose is true. An Assertion Gate compares two artifacts (ADR 0043);
 * "is this diagram clear" compares an artifact to a feeling.
 *
 * Rules are classified by kind (`RULE_KINDS`, ADR 0085). Every rule above the
 * citation rule is mechanical-hygiene: the `LEGACY` roster exempts a page from
 * these on the strength of one written reason. `checkCitations` carries the
 * factual-assertion rules — a citation must resolve, carry an expected-content
 * anchor, and match it, since resolution alone is necessary and not sufficient
 * (see its own comment) — and `LEGACY` does not exempt a page from them:
 * `scanDesignPage` runs everything for a `ROSTER` page, `scanFactualAssertions`
 * runs only these for a `LEGACY` one.

 * Replaces every comment with spaces, keeping newlines so offsets and line numbers

 * in a script comment, and scanning raw source reports that warning as the very
 * violation it warns about.
 *
 * The code flavours are masked only inside `<script>` and `<style>`, and that scope
 * is the whole point. Applied document-wide, a glob in prose — `release/*`,
 * `.github/workflows/*.yml`, `docs/**\/*.html` — opens a comment that never closes
 * where the author meant it to, and everything up to the next `*\/` anywhere in the
 * file is blanked. Every rule below runs on this output, so the blanked region is
 * not merely unscanned by one check: it is invisible to all of them. It happened:
 * a `release/**` in an SVG label on `release-pipeline.html` swallowed ~41 KB and
 * the page's manifest block, and the gate reported PASS on a page it had stopped
 * reading. A gate that fails open is worse than no gate, because ADR 0046 exists
 * so nobody has to read these pages by eye.
 *
 * The hazard was already known when this was written document-wide — the `/* … *\/`
 * above had to be escaped to keep this very comment from eating itself.
 *
 * A `<script type="application/json">` body is masked like any other, and the one
 * rule that needs it intact — `checkManifest`, which parses it — reads the raw
 * bytes at the offsets it located here. It is deliberately not exempted at this
 * level: every rule below runs on this output, so an exemption here widens what
 * *all* of them see, not just the parser. Two are satisfied by presence
 * (`checkTipNoteBijection`, `checkThemeTokens`) and `fontBlock` slices from the
 * last `@font-face` it can see, so a block quoting any of those inside `/* … *\/`
 * would be answering a rule with text the page only quotes. That is a fail-open in
 * the same family as the document-wide one above, bought to fix a parse.

 *   - a name counts only with a known file extension. `'localhost:3000'` and
 *     `'github.ref:88'` are not files; neither, here, is `.github/CODEOWNERS`.
 *   - a bare `:line` inherits only a file cited earlier in the same literal, or

 *     from the string before, so `'padding :4'` is never a citation, and

 *   - every `<script>` that is not a data block (`isDataBlock`). A type
 *     allowlist would be the wrong bound the other way: session-lifecycle.html
 *     keeps its scenes in a `text/x-dc` script.
 *   - what the lexer can classify. It tells a regex literal from a division by
 *     what precedes the `/`, which is a heuristic: where it guesses wrong, a
 *     quote or `//` inside the regex can cost the strings that follow it.
 *
 * Scripts are located with HTML comments blanked and nothing else: the script
 * comment masking `maskHtmlComments` applies is not string-aware, and blanks
 * the rest of the line after a `//` inside a code sample. `<style>` is matched
 * alongside so that a `<script>` named in a stylesheet comment starts nothing.

/**
 * A factual-assertion rule (ADR 0085): it runs over `LEGACY` pages as well as

 *
 * Resolving a citation here is necessary and not sufficient — it proves the claim
 * is *possible*, not that it is *true*. `resolveCitation` is asked only whether
 * some file named `name` exists with enough lines; it is not asked whether that
 * file is the right one, which needs the citation to carry the content it names
 * (#788's anchoring). A bare name with several same-named candidates in the tree
 * (`package.json`, `SKILL.md`) resolves if any one of them is long enough — this
 * step can tell an impossible citation from a possible one, not a right file from
 * a coincidentally long wrong one.
 *
 * Each citation is further checked against its expected-content anchor: the text
 * at the cited line(s) must be what the page claims is there. A citation carrying
 * no anchor is itself a finding (ADR 0085) — the requirement is per CITATION, not
 * per page. Keying it off the presence of a `citation-anchors` block would hold
 * only the pages that already opted in, so a page with no block at all would pass
 * by carrying nothing, which is the shape ADR 0043's marker objection warns about.
 *
 * `requireAnchors` is the migration hatch and nothing more: a page named in the
 * anchor baseline still has its citations resolved and any anchors it does carry
 * compared, it is simply not yet failed for the anchors it lacks. The baseline can
 * only shrink, so the hatch closes.
 *
 * The block is held to its citations in the other direction too (#822): an entry
 * that keys no citation this function extracts is never looked up above, so it
 * can quote anything — including something false — while reading, to a human, as
 * though the gate had checked it. That is an unasserted claim (ADR 0085), and
 * `requireAnchors` deliberately does NOT suppress it: the hatch excuses an anchor
 * that is absent, and an orphan is about what the block itself asserts. A page
 * owes nothing it has not written, so no page needs time to migrate out of it.
 *
 * "Extracts" is the operative word, and it bounds the claim. A citation the
 * scanner cannot read keys nothing, so its anchor is an orphan however true:
 *   - a continuation written without its colon (`main.mts:153, 205`) — which,
 *     in the comma-separated form `findUnparsedContinuations` reads, is also
 *     reported in its own right as `citation-continuation-unparsed`, since the
 *     reader sees a cited line the gate does not;
 *   - a citation in a `<script>` body that `locateScriptCitations` does not read:
 *     one in a comment, in code, or under a name with no known file extension.
 *     Nothing reports those themselves. A citation in a script string IS read
 *     (#982), and is held to every rule here like one in the markup.
 *
 * A block that is present and unreadable — invalid JSON, or no `anchors` map —
 * asserts nothing at all, and fails as `citation-anchor-block-invalid` rather
 * than being treated as a page with no block (#982). On a `ROSTER` page invalid
 * JSON is reported by `manifest-invalid` as well; a `LEGACY` page never runs
 * that rule, so this one cannot lean on it.
