/**
 * Which pages under `docs/` are House Explainer Pages, and which are deliberately
 * not gated. Scope is an explicit roster, not a glob (ADR 0046): `docs/**` holds
 * three lineages of HTML page and only one is this convention.
 *
 * This lives in its own module so the roster has exactly one definition. It was a
 * `const` inside `check-design-hygiene.mjs`, which the CLI cannot export without
 * running its whole main body on import, so the contract suite kept a hand-copied
 * mirror. The mirror rotted the first time the roster grew: the fixture workspace
 * writes one page per entry, so a page added to the checker and not to the copy
 * failed two tests with `page-missing` — a failure about bookkeeping wearing the
 * costume of a failure about the page.
