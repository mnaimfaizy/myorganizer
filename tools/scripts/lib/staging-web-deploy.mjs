/**
 * Decisions behind Staging's web deploy (issue #1138, ADR 0128).
 *
 * The Staging web app runs on a host where nothing automatic may open a shell:
 * the bundle arrives by FTP, the app restarts when `tmp/restart.txt` changes,
 * and an operator runs "Run NPM Install" by hand. This module makes the
 * decisions `deploy-staging.yml` needs, with every read of the host, of git
 * and of the Actions API injected so they run under test without any of them:
 *
 *   - whether the web address and the API address are on the same site;
 *   - whether the schedule should deploy at all, or would repeat or roll
 *     back what Staging already holds — its web app or its backend;
 *   - whether an upload may restart the app, or an install is owed first;
 *   - whether the build that answers is the build just uploaded.
 *
 * Two reads of the host mean different things, and the plan depends on the
 * difference. Files under the bundle's `public/` are served from disk, so
 * `/deploy-state.json` says what was last UPLOADED. The HTML of `/login` comes
 * from the Node process, so it says what is RUNNING. Neither needs a shell.
 * The second holds only while the root layout exports
 * `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`: a prerendered `/login` would be read from disk
 * and say what was uploaded, not what is running.
 *
 * A host that does not answer is not a host that holds nothing. A missing
 * state file (404) is the first deploy; a state file that cannot be read is
 * unknown, and both the schedule and the plan stop on it rather than guess.
 *
 * No function here puts an origin in a message: both addresses are GitHub
 * Environment secrets (ADR 0056), and a message names the path only.
 *
 * Run the tests with: yarn staging-web:test
