/**
 * Re-registers a slice worktree whose git admin directory was deleted.
 *
 * A linked worktree is two halves: the directory under `.sandcastle/worktrees/`
 * (with a `.git` FILE pointing at its admin directory) and the admin directory
 * itself, `.git/worktrees/<name>/`. Inside the sandbox the admin directory's
 * `gitdir` names a host path the container cannot see, so a `git worktree prune`
 * run there judges the slice's own worktree stale and deletes its admin half.
 * The files survive; git no longer knows them. Every later git call in the
 * directory — the run's own cleanup, the crash checkpoint, the resume rebuild —
 * fails with "is not a working tree", and the slice reads as crashed after its
 * agent finished (PRD #1206, slice #1207).
 *
 * Repair rewrites the admin directory from what is already known — the path the
 * `.git` file names and the slice branch — then rebuilds the index from the
 * branch tip. Working-tree files are never touched, so uncommitted edits stay
 * visible to the checkpoint capture that runs next.
 *
 * Run the tests with: yarn sandcastle:worktree-repair:test
