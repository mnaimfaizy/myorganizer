/**
 * The decision behind `nx:targets:check` (`tools/scripts/check-nx-declared-targets.mjs`):
 * a ratchet holding Declared Targets on `@nx/*` executors to a fixed baseline,
 * so the count can only shrink toward Nx's Inferred Targets (ADR 0082).
 *
 * A target is in scope only when its `project.json` entry names an executor
 * in the `@nx/` namespace. Three shapes are deliberately out of scope and
 * never appear in `classifyDeclaredTargets`'s output:
 *   - `nx:run-commands` targets, which are not Nx-plugin executors at all.
 *   - Third-party executors (`@driimus/nx-plugin-openapi:...`), which carry
 *     no Inferred Target migration path in Nx's own plugin set.
 *   - An override that declares `dependsOn` or `options` with no `executor`
 *     key — that shape configures the Inferred Target rather than replacing
 *     it, since Nx merges the two by target name; it is not a Declared Target.
 *
 * A baseline entry is keyed by project name, target name, and executor
 * together (`keyOf`), so a target that keeps its name but changes executor
 * reads as one baseline entry going stale and one new entry appearing, never
 * as a silent substitution.
 *
 * Debt is an `@nx/*` executor Nx has deprecated in favour of an inferred
 * plugin (ADR 0083, sharpening ADR 0082 decision 1). An `@nx/*` executor Nx
 * still ships as its own answer is not debt, and the file's `notDebt` list
 * names it by executor with a written `reason` and the `source` that shows
 * Nx has not deprecated it. Unlike a baseline entry, each `notDebt` entry is
 * its own decision, which is why it carries a reason. A target on a listed
 * executor is covered, not classified; a listed executor that covers no
 * target is stale, exactly like a baseline entry with no target, so the list
 * cannot outlive the last target that needed it.
