/**
 * Per-harness body sections for canonical sub-agent files.
 *
 * `.github/agents/*.agent.md` is the canonical body for every harness, and the
 * sync script overwrites each target's body from it wholesale. That is normally
 * what we want — one body, four harnesses — but some instructions only make
 * sense where a specific harness grants a specific tool. MCP tools are the
 * motivating case: the same graphify server is called `mcp__graphify__*` in
 * Claude Code, `mcp_graphify_*` in Gemini CLI, and `graphify/*` in Copilot.
 *
 * Writing those differences straight into a target file does not survive: the
 * next `yarn agents:sync` regenerates the body from canonical and the edit is
 * gone (this is exactly how the Graphify instrumentation was lost in 555fe1c).
 * So canonical carries them, wrapped in markers, and each target renders only
 * the blocks addressed to it:
 *
 *   <!-- harness:claude -->
 *   Claude-only text.
 *   <!-- /harness -->
 *
 *   <!-- harness:claude,cursor -->
 *   Text for both.
 *   <!-- /harness -->
 *
 * Unmarked content is universal. Markers must sit alone on their own line, and
 * blocks must not nest — both are enforced with a hard error rather than a
 * best-effort parse, because a marker that silently fails to apply reintroduces
 * the bug this mechanism exists to prevent.
 *
 * Note `.github/agents` is canonical, not a render target: Copilot reads the
 * file with the markers still in it and therefore sees every block. Keep block
 * contents short and self-labeling ("**Claude Code:** ...") so that reads as a
 * reference table rather than as contradictory instructions.
 *
 * Consumers: sync-subagents.mjs
