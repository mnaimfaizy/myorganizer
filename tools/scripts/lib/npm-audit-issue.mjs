/**
 * Decision logic for the npm audit issue (ADR 0124, issue #977).
 *
 * `Secure Install Review` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` audits every push to
 * `main` against the live advisory database, so `main` goes red the day an
 * advisory is published against a dependency already in the tree. Report
 * Audit Failure turns that red check into one issue titled
 * `AUDIT_ISSUE_TITLE` and comments on it while the audit keeps failing.
 * Report Audit Success is the other half: the first green push records the
 * recovery on that same issue.
 *
 * What recovery does with the issue is the nightly E2E rot issue's rule,
 * imported rather than restated: no triage state label and the issue is the
 * automation talking to itself, so recovery closes it; any one of them —
 * including `needs-triage`, which a newly created audit issue wears — and it
 * stays open for whoever owns it.
 *
 * Unlike the nightly, this reports per push, and `main` takes several pushes
 * a day. Every report therefore carries a marker naming the state it
 * reported, and `lastReportedState` reads the newest one, so a recovery is
 * recorded once and not again on every green push that follows it.
 *
 * The workflow jobs import this module. A second copy of the title or the
 * label list in YAML would be the drift this file exists to prevent.
 *
 * Run the tests with: yarn npm-audit:issue:test
