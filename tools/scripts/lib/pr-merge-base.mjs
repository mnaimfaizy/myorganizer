/**
 * Pure decision logic for the merge-base proof gate on `yarn ai:create-pr`.
 *
 * A fabricated commit message still lands attached to the real staged diff, so the
 * commit path is self-correcting. A fabricated PR body is the whole deliverable and
 * nothing downstream compares it to the branch. `PrAuthor` was observed returning a
 * complete, well-formed draft with `tool_uses: 0` — every fact synthesized from the
 * caller's prompt (issue #456).
 *
 * The gate asks for one fact the agent cannot guess from prompt context: the
 * merge-base SHA. The runner recomputes it and refuses drafts that cannot produce it.
 * This is a proof-of-inspection check, not a proof-of-accuracy one — an agent that
 * ran `git merge-base` proves only that it touched the branch, which is exactly the
 * failure mode observed and all this gate claims to close.
 *
 * Run the tests with: yarn ai:create-pr:test
