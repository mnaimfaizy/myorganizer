/**
 * Splitting a documented shell command into tokens.
 *
 * Two checkers need the same split and needed it differently at first:
 * `check-doc-commands.mjs` asks which tokens name a file, and
 * `check-review-tool-allowlist.mjs` asks whether a command's leading tokens
 * are the ones an allowlist entry permits. Both answers are wrong the moment
 * the split is wrong, and both are wrong in the same way — a quoted argument
 * cut on its spaces becomes several tokens nobody wrote. `"Vault Trust
 * Boundary.dc.html"` is one filename; `sed -n '1,20p'` is three tokens, not
 * four.
 *
 * So the split lives here rather than as a copy in each file, for the reason
 * `tools/scripts/review/cli.mjs` gives for its own contents: two copies of one
 * rule drift, and the drift is silent.

/**
 * Split one command line into tokens, keeping a quoted argument whole.

/**
 * Split a shell call into its simple commands, at `&&`, `||`, `;`, `|`, and a
 * newline. Quoted text is kept whole, so a `;` inside a quoted pattern does
 * not start a command; so is a character a backslash escapes, and a
 * backslash at the end of a line continues the command onto the next.
 *
 * The quotes and backslashes are left in each command, for a caller that
 * goes on to split it into words. A here-document's body is not recognised:
 * its lines come back as commands, and a caller that cares must look for the
 * `<<` itself.
