/**
 * The decision behind `gates:coverage:check` (`tools/scripts/check-gate-coverage.mjs`):
 * which `check-*.mjs` scripts are Wired Gates, and which run nowhere.
 *
 * ADR 0043's corollary is that a gate nobody runs asserts nothing, so a
 * checker no pipeline invokes is a defect of the same class as a checker that
 * is wrong. Nine checkers were in that state when #438 was designed, and one
 * of them had been failing on `main` for days with nobody watching.
 *
 * Three rules carry all the risk here, and each one is a mistake already made:
 *
 *   1. **Detection is by filename**, `check-*.mjs` in the scripts directory —
 *      never by a `*:check` script-name suffix. `openapi:artifacts` and
 *      `component:hygiene` carry no such suffix, and the first is one of the
 *      two unwired checks that motivated the rule. Selecting on a *name* is
 *      also exactly why `check-lint-coverage.mjs` had to exist.
 *   2. **Matching is exact.** During design a substring match on
 *      `yarn openapi:artifacts` also matched `openapi:artifacts:test` and
 *      reported the unwired check as wired. A contract-test script never
 *      satisfies its sibling checker's wiring requirement — running the
 *      contracts proves the checker works, not that anything runs it.
 *   3. **Indirection resolves exactly one level.** The pre-commit hook calls
 *      one aggregate runner rather than one line per checker (ADR 0043), so a
 *      meta-gate reading only hooks and workflows would report every checker
 *      the aggregate runs as unwired — including on the change that wired
 *      them. A checker the aggregate's manifest names counts as wired, but
 *      only while the aggregate itself is invoked by a pipeline. A manifest
 *      entry that is itself an aggregate is an error, not a recursion.
 *
 * Comments are stripped from pipeline files before matching. Both
 * `.husky/pre-commit` and `.github/workflows/ci.yml` mention gate commands in
 * prose; counting a comment as wiring would mean deleting the run line while
 * its explanation stayed behind left the gate green.
 *
 * Two limits are deliberate, and neither is a bug to be found later:
 *
 *   - Wiring is a text match, so a name inside an `echo` or a step carrying
 *     `if: false` counts. Deciding what a workflow *actually executes* means
 *     evaluating YAML conditions and job graphs; the requirement is the exact
 *     script name in a hook or workflow, and comment stripping already covers
 *     the case that occurs in this repo.
 *   - A nested aggregate is recognised by the shape a runner here has: it
 *     calls `runGateManifest`, or it reads a manifest and spawns. One that
 *     does neither is treated as a leaf, which fails safe — the checkers
 *     behind it report as unwired rather than being laundered as reached.
 *
 * `assertGateCoverage` is pure — every input is passed in, so the contract
 * tests exercise fixtures rather than the repository. `gatherFromDisk` is the
 * only part that reads files.
