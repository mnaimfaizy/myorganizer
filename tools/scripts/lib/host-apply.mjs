/**
 * Pure decision logic for CI-owned Host Apply (ADR 0056, issue #566).
 *
 * A failed migration and then a stale Prisma client both shipped to Production
 * because "go live" stayed on interactive SSH, run only when someone remembered.
 * This module is the part of that sequence CI can own without ever holding
 * `DATABASE_URL` itself: it takes the resolved values of the named
 * secrets (`HOST_APPLY_SECRET_NAMES`) from the caller — the GitHub Actions
 * workflow built in #567 — and produces the on-host command sequence, refuses
 * unsafe inputs, and can grade a captured log for a leaked credential.
 * `DATABASE_URL` is the one value this module never takes as input and never
 * emits: the generated script loads it on the host, at apply time, from the
 * selector store. It never opens a real SSH connection — verifying that
 * belongs to a live host, not a unit test.
 *
 * Run the tests with: yarn host-apply:test
