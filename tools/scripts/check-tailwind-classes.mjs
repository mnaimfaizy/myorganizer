// Fails a Tailwind utility that names a theme value and compiles to no CSS (ADR 0065).
//
//   node tools/scripts/check-tailwind-classes.mjs [--print]
//
// Tailwind drops a class name it cannot resolve. There is no build error, no
// warning, and no missing-file failure — the element simply renders unstyled.
// `libs/web/pages/groceries` shipped 212 such occurrences across 25 names
// (issue #632): a Material Design 3 vocabulary — `surface-container-low`,
// `on-surface-variant`, `outline-variant` — that existed in neither the design
// tokens nor either Tailwind config. Twelve Jest assertions pinned those names
// and stayed green the whole time, because `toHaveClass` cares whether a string
// is in an attribute, not whether it paints anything.
//
// Resolution is delegated to Tailwind itself rather than reimplemented. A
// hand-maintained list of valid suffixes is the obvious approach and the wrong
// one: it has to know that `text-xs`, `text-center` and `max-w-md` are fine
// while `text-error` is not, and it is wrong again the day someone adds a
// Semantic Role. Compiling the real stylesheet — with its `@config`, its
// imported generated roles, and both Tailwind configs — asks the only authority
// that can answer.
//
// Candidates come from Tailwind's own scanner (`@tailwindcss/oxide`) for the
// same reason. Regex extraction was tried while diagnosing #632 and produced
// false positives from a `file-text-icon` test id and a `delete-from-catalog`
// test name. A gate that cries wolf is a gate people learn to skip.
//
// Two scope decisions, both load-bearing:
//
//   * `libs/email-shell` and `libs/mobile` are excluded. Neither renders through
//     Tailwind — the email shell emits inline CSS for mail clients, and mobile
//     uses React Native `StyleSheet` (ADR 0008). Their CSS property names
//     (`border-bottom`, `text-decoration`) are class-shaped, and they are the
//     only false positives this check was measured to have.
//   * Test files are deliberately IN scope. They contribute no false positives,
//     and a test asserting a class name that paints nothing is the exact failure
//     #632 turned on.
//
// Spacing and radius are in scope alongside colour: `py-md` and `gap-sm` named
// design-token steps no Tailwind config exposes and failed exactly the same
// silent way, found by this check while it still only looked at colour.
//
// Arbitrary values (`bg-[var(--color-surface,#F8FAFC)]`) are skipped. Tailwind
// emits those verbatim, so they cannot silently resolve to nothing the way a
// named token can; the authentication pages use them legitimately.
//
// Exit 0 = every themed utility resolves. Exit 1 = at least one paints nothing.
// Exit 2 = the check could not run.
