//
//   node tools/scripts/check-review-tool-allowlist.mjs [--print]
//
// Both sides are files. The instruction side is
// `.agents/skills/code-review/SKILL.md` and `docs/review/REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`;
// the permission side is the `--allowedTools` list in
// `.github/actions/code-reviewer/action.yml`, which is what the reviewer's
// harness enforces in CI. Nothing here reads a transcript: a transcript
// artifact expires after seven days, so a check that depended on one could not
// be run against the tree at any later commit.
//
// This is the Meta-Gate's own reasoning — a checker nothing runs is not a gate
// — applied to the allowlist: an instruction the reviewer is refused
// permission to follow is an instruction nothing can carry out. It is not
// free, either. In golden replay run 45 the guard case
// `groceries-blob-type-without-fanouts` died at `error_max_turns` with 26
// permission denials against 81 turns — roughly a third of the budget spent
// being told no, and no report written at all, so the run measured nothing
// (docs/research/2026-09-10-the-answer-sheet-is-inert.md).
//
// What counts as an instruction, and why it is drawn this wide:
//
//   - Every command line in a fenced `bash`/`sh`/`shell`/`console` block.
//   - Every inline code span that reads as a command, in prose and inside any
//     other fence: its first token is a program (`yarn`, `git`, `sed`, …) and
//     it carries an argument, or it is a package.json script name.
//     `openapi:check` is how the checklist names the gate the reviewer must
//     run, and a rule that only understood a leading `yarn` would miss the one
//     obligation that instructs running anything.
//   - A script written as a *shape* rather than a name — "the `*:check`
//     gates" — expanded to every script it names. It is the broadest
//     instruction either document gives, and reading it as prose would leave
//     this gate reporting only whichever literal spellings happen to be
//     written down nearby.
//
// A checklist entry's `Why this exists` paragraph is skipped — that block is
// one of the four things the checklist says an entry answers, and it is the
// one written in the past tense. `openapi:sync` appears there because a
// release once skipped it, which is a fact about 2026 and not a command
// anybody is being handed.
//
// Under-reporting is the failure this gate exists to close, so the reading is
// deliberately broad and the suppressions are written down instead. Both
// documents have two readers — a terminal session and a CI job — and they also
// name machinery by its script name (`review:publish`, `review:spec`) while
// telling the reviewer not to run it. `NOT_THE_REVIEWERS_TO_RUN` records that
// judgement once, with a reason each, and an entry that stops matching
// anything is an error rather than a silent no-op.
//
// Matching is token-wise, not string-prefix. `Bash(sed -n:*)` permits a
// command whose first two tokens are exactly `sed` and `-n`; it permits
// nothing about `sed '1,20p' file`, which is the shape that leaves an entry
// carrying a flag matching nothing anyone was told to run. A token the
// instruction leaves as a placeholder (`<project>`, `$BRANCH`) matches
// anything, because the document did not fix it.
//
// A trailing ` *` is the same prefix rule as `:*` and also matches the bare
// command, and a `*` anywhere else matches any text, spaces included — Claude
// Code's documented rule syntax, which `.claude/settings.json` is written in.
// Reading ` *` as a literal last token, as this checker once did, made every
// rule in that form catch only commands of exactly its own length: the
// interception direction under-reported, the failure this gate exists to rule
// out, and it still printed OK.
//
// The permission side is two files, not one, and that is the whole of what
// golden replay run 46 cost a fifth of its turn budget to learn. `--allowedTools`
// adds *allow* rules; the repository's own `.claude/settings.json` is loaded as
// project settings by the same session, and Claude Code evaluates `deny`, then
// `ask`, then `allow`. An `ask` match therefore beats an `--allowedTools` grant
// — and in a headless run there is nobody to ask, so it resolves as a refusal.
// That is the asymmetry: `git worktree add` matches no `ask` rule and ran,
// while `git worktree remove` matches `Bash(git worktree remove:*)` in the
// settings' `ask` list and was refused eleven times under the same
// `Bash(git worktree:*)` grant. `node -e` is the same mechanism on an unrelated
// command, refused while `Bash(node:*)` was granted
// (docs/research/2026-09-22-a-project-ask-rule-is-a-refusal-in-ci.md, ADR 0099).
//
// So this checker asserts two directions, and both are needed:
//
//   1. Every instructed command is *permitted* by `--allowedTools`. An
//      instruction nothing grants is an instruction nothing can carry out.
//   2. No instructed command is *intercepted* by an `ask` or `deny` rule in
//      `.claude/settings.json`. A grant an interposed rule overrides is a
//      permission the reviewer does not actually have, which is exactly the
//      gap direction 1 passed straight through for two runs.
//
// No third direction is asserted, and the omission is deliberate: an
// `--allowedTools` entry matching no instruction is *not* failed here. #715
// removed `Bash(sed -n:*)` on that reading and the reviewer was refused `sed`
// anyway — the entry was never what refused it. An unused grant costs a turn
// only if something instructs it, which direction 1 already covers.
//
// Exit 0 = every instructed command is permitted and none is intercepted.
// Exit 1 = at least one is refused, each named with its instruction site and
// either the nearest allow entry or the interposed rule. Exit 2 = could not run.
