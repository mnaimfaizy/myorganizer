// The escaped-defect rate (ADR 0077) is a fraction whose numerator is built
// from fixes that name their root cause. Its first measurement read 57 fixes
// and found that none did, so the rate could never leave `not measurable`.
// Nothing asked a fix to write the fact down; ADR 0077's consequences named
// the line — `Introduced in #415` — and a sentence is not an assertion
// (ADR 0085).
//
// This check **asks the measurement** rather than restating it: whether the
// Pull Request is a fix is `pullRequestType` from measure-escaped-defects.mjs,
// and whether its commits attribute the defect is `attributeFix` from
// escaped-defects.mjs, over the same `%s%n%b` text the measurement reads. A
// copy of either would agree on the examples in a test and drift on
// everything else (ADR 0076 item 4) — and a gate that passed a line the
// measurement cannot read would be satisfied while the rate stayed empty.
//
// ASSERTS: when the Pull Request is a fix — a `fix/` branch, or a `fix`
// Conventional Commit title on a branch whose prefix names no type — at least
// one commit in `base..head` carries a line the measurement reads as
// attribution: any `ROOT_CAUSE_MARKERS` phrasing, of which `Introduced in #N`
// is the one documented, or the declaration `Introduced in unknown: <why>`.
//
// DOES NOT ASSERT that the reference is right, that it resolves to a merged
// Pull Request, or that it is earlier than the fix. Those are facts about
// history the measurement already classifies (`unresolved`, `not-earlier`),
// where a wrong reference is counted and visible; failing a Pull Request over
// them would make the author argue with the archaeology in CI.
//
// DOES NOT READ the Pull Request body or the closing issue. The measurement
// reads both, but only with a token, and its first run had none: commits are
// the one source every measurement reads, so they are the one source this
// gate accepts. A fix whose only attribution is in its body fails here and
// would have measured nothing on a git-only run.
//
// Exit 0 = not a fix, or the fix names its origin. Exit 1 = a fix that does
// not. Exit 2 = could not run.
