// Runs every cheap, file-reading Assertion Gate checker (ADR 0043) in one Node
// process, reporting every failure rather than stopping at the first.
//
//   node tools/scripts/run-assertion-gates.mjs
//
// Six checkers — readme, OpenAPI artifacts, agent map, vault pages, auth
// pages, and sub-agent sync — ran nowhere, and ADR numbering ran as its own
// `corepack yarn` line; the gate-coverage meta-gate joined them here rather
// than adding a tenth. The environment and feature-index checkers (issue
// #465) were designed alongside this file and wired here from the start.
// Each `corepack yarn` invocation costs roughly 1.3s of process overhead
// against roughly 350ms of actual checker work, so wiring each as its own
// hook line would add about ten seconds to every commit to do about two
// seconds of checking. This is the one line `.husky/pre-commit` calls
// instead.
//
// Each checker still runs as its own `node` subprocess rather than an
// in-process import: several call `process.exit` directly on failure, which
// would kill the aggregate itself before the remaining checkers ran. The
// per-check npm scripts remain for isolated runs, and CI still invokes each
// check as its own named step for a readable failure.
//
// The manifest (tools/scripts/lib/gate-manifest.mjs) is asserted against
// package.json before anything runs: a checker quietly dropped from it would
// be exactly the unwired-gate defect this file exists to close.
//
// Exit 0 = every checker passed. Exit 1 = at least one checker found drift.
// Exit 2 = the manifest itself no longer matches package.json / disk.
