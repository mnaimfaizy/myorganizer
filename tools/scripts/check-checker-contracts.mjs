// Ratchets contract-suite coverage for tools/scripts/check-*.mjs checkers
// against a shrink-only baseline, so the count of untested checkers can only
// go down (ADR 0085).
//
//   node tools/scripts/check-checker-contracts.mjs [--print]
//
// ADR 0043 already asked a checker's header to state which drift direction(s)
// it asserts. Only 5 of 35 non-test checkers did — and check-readme.mjs, the
// one that followed the convention best, stated in exactly the fixed form the
// convention asked for that "drift runs both ways" over code that implements
// one direction. Writing a direction down does not make it true; a contract
// suite proving the checker actually fails on the drift its header claims to
// catch is what makes it true. This gate makes carrying one somebody's job.
//
// A checker "has a contract suite" when tools/scripts/check-x.mjs has a
// sibling tools/scripts/check-x.test.mjs — the same file-adjacency
// convention this codebase's checkers already use for their own tests.
// Thirteen of thirty-five checkers had none on the day this baseline was
// seeded; the baseline records that as debt with a direction of travel, and
// this gate asserts both directions of the ratchet: a checker with no suite
// and no baseline entry is new, untracked debt, and a baseline entry naming a
// checker that is no longer debt (it gained a suite, or the checker itself is
// gone) is stale.
//
// This mirrors tools/scripts/check-nx-declared-targets.mjs (ADR 0082)
// deliberately — same ratchet shape, including that a baseline entry
// covering nothing fails as stale. Unlike
// tools/config/gate-coverage-optout.json, there is deliberately no
// written-reason opt-out list: a per-checker "not worth testing" judgment
// call is exactly the discretion this baseline exists to remove.
//
// Exit 0 = every checker without a contract suite is in the baseline, and
// every baseline entry still lacks one. Exit 1 = a checker lacks both a
// suite and a baseline entry, or a baseline entry's checker is no longer
// debt. Exit 2 = the baseline is missing/malformed, or no checkers were found.
