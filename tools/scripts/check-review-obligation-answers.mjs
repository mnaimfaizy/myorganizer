//
// Thoroughness never fails a review. An unanswered obligation is a fact about
// the review's thoroughness — neither a fact about the pipeline nor a judgment
// about the diff (ADR 0073), and the finding contract is untouched by it
// (ADR 0071: a report is accepted or rejected whole, so a malformed answer
// sheet must not be able to take the findings down with it).
//
// What it buys is a split that did not exist before. A missed defect used to
// look the same whatever caused it; now it reads as one of three:
//
//   not selected      -> the trigger is wrong. Fix the pattern; it is cheap.
//   selected, unanswered -> the forcing function is too weak.
//   answered, no finding -> a capability limit, and now known to be one.
//
// It sits in tools/scripts/ rather than beside obligations.mjs because
// gates:coverage:check discovers checkers with a NON-RECURSIVE scan of that
// directory (tools/scripts/lib/gate-coverage.mjs). A check-*.mjs in a
// subdirectory is invisible to the Meta-Gate: it would look wired forever,
// and if the workflow line invoking it were deleted nothing would notice.
// That is precisely the shape ADR 0074 names — a checker nothing runs — so
// this file is named and placed to be seen.
//
// Thoroughness never fails a review. Two other things do, and they are a
// different kind of fact — about the reviewer, not about the diff (ADR 0078,
// on the ground ADR 0073 already holds):
//
//   A SELF-CONTRADICTION. An answer that meets its obligation's own declared
//   defect condition while raising no finding is not a judgment the reviewer is
//   entitled to make, because the catalogue already decided that answer is a
//   finding. Run 45 is the case: `import-confirm` wrote
//   `namesEverything: false`, whose defect rule says in as many words that
//   false is a finding, and raised nothing; the completeness report called that
//   sheet complete.
//
//   A CITATION THAT DOES NOT MATCH ITS SOURCE. Every answer field that makes a
//   claim about source carries the file, the line, and the literal text at that
//   line, and this script reads that line out of the tree at the reviewed head
//   and compares it. Run 45 again: `signup` wrote `slotChild: "Input"` for the
//   two sites whose direct child is a positioning `div`, and nothing compared
//   the writing to anything. Presence was never the weak point — a wrong
//   element name is a perfectly non-blank string.
//
// Both are Assertion Gates in the ADR 0043 sense - two artifacts compared, a
// factual mismatch named - not an opinion about the diff. Neither produces a
// finding: a finding is about the code under review, and this is not.
//
// Exit 0 = answered or thin, but sound.
// Exit 1 = an answer contradicts its own defect rule, or a quotation does not
//          match the tree at head.
// Exit 2 = the script could not run (missing file, unreadable JSON, bad shape).
