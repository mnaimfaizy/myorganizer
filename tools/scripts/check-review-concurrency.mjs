// Asserts that the code review workflow's concurrency group and its `context`
// job's `if:` agree about which triggers are inert.
//
//   node tools/scripts/check-review-concurrency.mjs [--print]
//
// The two are written in the same language about the same event payload, and
// they cannot be shared: `concurrency` is evaluated when the run is created,
// before any job `if:` is read. That gap is the whole reason this check
// exists. A run whose jobs all skip is not a harmless run — it still joins the
// concurrency group, and with `cancel-in-progress` it takes the in-flight
// review with it.
//
// It happened three times in one morning. `ai:create-pr` adds labels a second
// after opening a pull request, and those `labeled` runs cancelled the review
// on #687 and #690. The fix sent them to a group of their own, and a
// GitGuardian comment on #693 did the same thing an hour later through the
// `issue_comment` trigger, which had been left in the shared group — invisible
// where anyone would look, because `issue_comment` runs are attributed to the
// default branch and never appear when listing runs for the pull request's
// branch. Then the shared inert group cancelled itself on #694.
//
// So the invariant is: every trigger the `context` job refuses must also be
// steered out of the review's concurrency group. This cannot be checked by
// evaluating the expressions — that would mean implementing GitHub's
// expression language — so it is checked structurally, on the two literals
// that decide it. If someone renames the trigger label or the command, both
// places have to change, and this fails until they do.
//
// Exit 0 = the two agree. Exit 1 = they have drifted. Exit 2 = could not run.
