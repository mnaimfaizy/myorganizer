/**
 * The #771 replay: the citation gate, run against the real page and the real
 * drift rather than a fixture (ADR 0085; PRD #772, slice #788).
 *
 * The contract suites next door build their own pages, so they prove the rule
 * fires on the shapes they invent. That is not the same claim as "this gate
 * would have caught the drift that motivated it" — the gate this PRD built
 * exists because #771 found 19 stale citations on `release-pipeline.html`, and
 * a suite of fixtures cannot say whether those particular nineteen would have
 * been caught. Only history can, so this file reads it.
 *
 * Two directions, because they fail for different reasons and a gate that
 * caught only one of them would still be the defect this PRD is named for:
 *
 *   1. The page as it stood BEFORE #771 — stale citations, no anchors — must
 *      fail. Every one of those citations pointed at a line that exists, so
 *      resolution alone cannot fail them; the anchor requirement is what does.
 *   2. The page as it stands NOW, read against the source tree as it stood
 *      before #771, must fail on CONTENT. This is the discriminating half: the
 *      citations resolve, carry anchors, and are still wrong for that tree.
